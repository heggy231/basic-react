WDI note:
- cool fact: 
* 7,500,000,000 (7.5 billion) people living on earth and more than half of them use the Internet; you just hit the mother lode.

* Developer foundation: Internet vs Web
- 2 or more cpu connected it forms computer network
interconnected computer network (internet)
The Web: The way data can be transferred: 
- Popular method: world wide web:
  HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol

  Domain Name: Title where you enter website, A unique name that
    id a website.

  How we find the right server?  
    Every cpu has an unique address. IP address. 
    IP add: long strings of numbers >> It is hard to remember
    Therefore, we give it a domain names ex) google.com heggy.me
    When you type in domain name: (Domain Name System: DNS) 
  DNS: A service to locate website thru user-friendly names
    once you find the server: it will send you assets you need.

  ![how We get website](https://cdn.glitch.com/cb093bfd-142f-45b3-bdb4-52ff49e0a1c2%2FScreen%20Shot%202018-12-26%20at%201.20.59%20AM.png?1545816105935)

  1) Domain Name (starts from you (client) looking up GA site) >
  2) Domain Name System (DNS) will look up IP Address (101.44.234.155) >
  3) IP address is like a postal address that is unique and locates your server!
  4) Files saved in server will be served to client.

Tips on how to think like developer:
- name your asset descriptive, remember to add title!
- Reliable search result: w3schools.com, codepen.io, stackoverflow
    stackoverflow: most of your answers have been answered!

- Best practice on googling:
  ex) look up add an alert function to your page using JavaScript
  "alert method JavaScript" or aler method js
<h2>JavaScript Alert function </h2>
<button onclick="alertBoxFunction()">Try</button>

<script>
function alertBoxFunction() {
  alert("I am an alert box!")
}
</script>

As you know, googling something doesn't always lead to a perfect answer or an exact solution. It's equally important to have other online resources and eventually learn to identify and fix errors on your own.

The video in this lesson mentions W3Schools, CodePen, and Stack Overflow as helpful debugging resources. Professional developers use a number of different resources and may prefer some over others. A sampling of these is listed here:

Mozilla Developer Network — a detailed technical documentation of front-end languages, written by the developers of Firefox.

![HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)  — a tool for checking markup accuracy.

![CSS Lint](http://csslint.net/) — a tool for checking CSS accuracy.

![JSLint](http://jslint.com/) — a tool for checking JavaScript code quality.

![JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/?html,css,output), ![JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), and repl.it — useful online code editors.

## Developer tools
 ### Git Bash
 GUI: Graphical User Interface, combine text, images, gestures

 CLI: Command Line Interface, journey toward transcending ordinary computer use > become developer who interact with computer through Command Line Interface (CLI) - communicate text alone.

 CLI ex) `echo`
 cpu will say whatever you tell it.
    > echo pick up milk cookie
    output: pick up milk cookie
  Terminal app aka 'shell': called Bash


  To open Terminal: Command Space to open iterm

  Web Browser: communicates with servers and allows client to connect to wwweb!

Command-Line Options
Unix tradition encourages the use of command-line switches to control programs, so that options can be specified from scripts. This is especially important for programs that function as pipes or filters. Three conventions for how to distinguish command-line options from ordinary arguments exist; the original Unix style, the GNU style, and the X toolkit style.

In the original Unix tradition, command-line options are single letters preceded by a single hyphen. Mode-flag options that do not take following arguments can be ganged together; thus, if -a and -b are mode options, -ab or -ba is also correct and enables both. The argument to an option, if any, follows it (optionally separated by whitespace). In this style, lowercase options are preferred to uppercase. When you use uppercase options, it's good form for them to be special variants of the lowercase option.

The original Unix style evolved on slow ASR-33 teletypes that made terseness a virtue; thus the single-letter options. Holding down the shift key required actual effort; thus the preference for lower case, and the use of “-” (rather than the perhaps more logical “+”) to enable options.

The GNU style uses option keywords (rather than keyword letters) preceded by two hyphens. It evolved years later when some of the rather elaborate GNU utilities began to run out of single-letter option keys (this constituted a patch for the symptom, not a cure for the underlying disease). It remains popular because GNU options are easier to read than the alphabet soup of older styles. GNU-style options cannot be ganged together without separating whitespace. An option argument (if any) can be separated by either whitespace or a single “=” (equal sign) character.

The GNU double-hyphen option leader was chosen so that traditional single-letter options and GNU-style keyword options could be unambiguously mixed on the same command line. Thus, if your initial design has few and simple options, you can use the Unix style without worrying about causing an incompatible ‘flag day’ if you need to switch to GNU style later on. On the other hand, if you are using the GNU style, it is good practice to support single-letter equivalents for at least the most common options.

The X toolkit style, confusingly, uses a single hyphen and keyword options. It is interpreted by X toolkits that filter out and process certain options (such as -geometry and -display) before handing the filtered command line to the application logic for interpretation. The X toolkit style is not properly compatible with either the classic Unix or GNU styles, and should not be used in new programs unless the value of being compatible with older X conventions seems very high.

Many tools accept a bare hyphen, not associated with any option letter, as a pseudo-filename directing the application to read from standard input. It is also conventional to recognize a double hyphen as a signal to stop option interpretation and treat all following arguments literally.

Most Unix programming languages offer libraries that will parse a command line for you in either classic-Unix or GNU style (interpreting the double-hyphen convention as well).

The -a to -z of Command-Line Options
Over time, frequently-used options in well-known Unix programs have established a loose sort of semantic standard for what various flags might be expected to mean. The following is a list of options and meanings that should prove usefully unsurprising to an experienced Unix user:

-a
All (without argument). If there is a GNU-style --all option, for -a to be anything but a synonym for it would be quite surprising. Examples: fuser(1), fetchmail(1).

Append, as in tar(1). This is often paired with -d for delete.

-b
Buffer or block size (with argument). Set a critical buffer size, or (in a program having to do with archiving or managing storage media) set a block size. Examples: du(1), df(1), tar(1).

Batch. If the program is naturally interactive, -b may be used to suppress prompts or set other options appropriate to accepting input from a file rather than a human operator. Example: flex(1).

-c
Command (with argument). If the program is an interpreter that normally takes commands from standard input, it is expected that the option of a -c argument will be passed to it as a single line of input. This convention is particularly strong for shells and shell-like interpreters. Examples: sh(1), ash(1), bsh(1), ksh(1), python(1). Compare -e below.

Check (without argument). Check the correctness of the file argument(s) to the command, but don't actually perform normal processing. Frequently used as a syntax-check option by programs that do interpretation of command files. Examples: getty(1), perl(1).

-d
Debug (with or without argument). Set the level of debugging messages. This one is very common.

Occasionally -d has the sense of ‘delete’ or ‘directory’.

-D
Define (with argument). Set the value of some symbol in an interpreter, compiler, or (especially) macro-processor-like application. The model is the use of -D by the C compiler's macro preprocessor. This is a strong association for most Unix programmers; don't try to fight it.

-e
Execute (with argument). Programs that are wrappers, or that can be used as wrappers, often allow -e to set the program they hand off control to. Examples: xterm(1), perl(1).

Edit. A program that can open a resource in either a read-only or editable mode may allow -e to specify opening in the editable mode. Examples: crontab(1), and the get(1) utility of the SCCS version-control system.

Occasionally -e has the sense of ‘exclude’ or ‘expression’.

-f
File (with argument). Very often used with an argument to specify an input (or, less frequently, output) file for programs that need to randomly access their input or output (so that redirection via < or > won't suffice). The classic example is tar(1); others abound. It is also used to indicate that arguments normally taken from the command line should be taken from a file instead; see awk(1) and egrep(1) for classic examples. Compare -o below; often, -f is the input-side analog of -o.

Force (typically without argument). Force some operation (such as a file lock or unlock) that is normally performed conditionally. This is less common.

Daemons often use -f in a way that combines these two meanings, to force processing of a configuration file from a nondefault location. Examples: ssh(1), httpd(1), and many other daemons.

-h
Headers (typically without argument). Enable, suppress, or modify headers on a tabular report generated by the program. Examples: pr(1), ps(1).

Help. This is actually less common than one might expect offhand — for much of Unix's early history developers tended to think of on-line help as memory-footprint overhead they couldn't afford. Instead they wrote manual pages (this shaped the man-page style in ways we'll discuss in Chapter 18).

-i
Initialize (usually without argument). Set some critical resource or database associated with the program to an initial or empty state. Example: ci(1) in RCS.

Interactive (usually without argument). Force a program that does not normally query for confirmation to do so. There are classical examples (rm(1), mv(1)) but this use is not common.

-I
Include (with argument). Add a file or directory name to those searched for resources by the application. All Unix compilers with any equivalent of source-file inclusion in their languages use -I in this sense. It would be extremely surprising to see this option letter used in any other way.

-k
Keep (without argument). Suppress the normal deletion of some file, message, or resource. Examples: passwd(1), bzip(1), and fetchmail(1).

Occasionally -k has the sense of ‘kill’.

-l
List (without argument). If the program is an archiver or interpreter/player for some kind of directory or archive format, it would be quite surprising for -l to do anything but request an item listing. Examples: arc(1), binhex(1), unzip(1). (However, tar(1) and cpio(1) are exceptions.)

In programs that are already report generators, -l almost invariably means “long” and triggers some kind of long-format display revealing more detail than the default mode. Examples: ls(1), ps(1).

Load (with argument). If the program is a linker or a language interpreter, -l invariably loads a library, in some appropriate sense. Examples: gcc(1), f77(1), emacs(1).

Login. In programs such as rlogin(1) and ssh(1) that need to specify a network identity, -l is how you do it.

Occasionally -l has the sense of ‘length’ or ‘lock’.

-m
Message (with argument). Used with an argument, -m passes it in as a message string for some logging or announcement purpose. Examples: ci(1), cvs(1).

Occasionally -m has the sense of ‘mail’, ‘mode’, or ‘modification-time’.

-n
Number (with argument). Used, for example, for page number ranges in programs such as head(1), tail(1), nroff(1), and troff(1). Some networking tools that normally display DNS names accept -n as an option that causes them to display the raw IP addresses instead; ifconfig(1) and tcpdump(1) are the archetypal examples.

Not (without argument). Used to suppress normal actions in programs such as make(1).

-o
Output (with argument). When a program needs to specify an output file or device by name on the command line, the -o option does it. Examples: as(1), cc(1), sort(1). On anything with a compiler-like interface, it would be extremely surprising to see this option used in any other way. Programs that support -o often (like gcc) have logic that allows it to be recognized after ordinary arguments as well as before.

-p
Port (with argument). Especially used for options that specify TCP/IP port numbers. Examples: cvs(1), the PostgreSQL tools, the smbclient(1), snmpd(1), ssh(1).

Protocol (with argument). Examples: fetchmail(1), snmpnetstat(1).

-q
Quiet (usually without argument). Suppress normal result or diagnostic output. This is very common. Examples: ci(1), co(1), make(1). See also the ‘silent’ sense of -s.

-r (also -R)
Recurse (without argument). If the program operates on a directory, then this option might tell it to recurse on all subdirectories. Any other use in a utility that operated on directories would be quite surprising. The classic example is, of course, cp(1).

Reverse (without argument). Examples: ls(1), sort(1). A filter might use this to reverse its normal translation action (compare -d).

-s
Silent (without argument). Suppress normal diagnostic or result output (similar to -q; when both are supported, q means ‘quiet’ but -s means ‘utterly silent’). Examples: csplit(1), ex(1), fetchmail(1).

Subject (with argument). Always used with this meaning on commands that send or manipulate mail or news messages. It is extremely important to support this, as programs that send mail expect it. Examples: mail(1), elm(1), mutt(1).

Occasionally -s has the sense of ‘size’.

-t
Tag (with argument). Name a location or give a string for a program to use as a retrieval key. Especially used with text editors and viewers. Examples: cvs(1), ex(1), less(1), vi(1).

-u
User (with argument). Specify a user, by name or numeric UID. Examples: crontab(1), emacs(1), fetchmail(1), fuser(1), ps(1).

-v
Verbose (with or without argument). Used to enable transaction-monitoring, more voluminous listings, or debugging output. Examples: cat(1), cp(1), flex(1), tar(1), many others.

Version (without argument). Display program's version on standard output and exit. Examples: cvs(1), chattr(1), patch(1), uucp(1). More usually this action is invoked by -V.

-V
Version (without argument). Display program's version on standard output and exit (often also prints compiled-in configuration details as well). Examples: gcc(1), flex(1), hostname(1), many others. It would be quite surprising for this switch to be used in any other way.

-w
Width (with argument). Especially used for specifying widths in output formats. Examples: faces(1), grops(1), od(1), pr(1), shar(1).

Warning (without argument). Enable warning diagnostics, or suppress them. Examples: fetchmail(1), flex(1), nsgmls(1).

-x
Enable debugging (with or without argument). Like -d. Examples: sh(1), uucp(1).

Extract (with argument). List files to be extracted from an archive or working set. Examples: tar(1), zip(1).

-y
Yes (without argument). Authorize potentially destructive actions for which the program would normally require confirmation. Examples: fsck(1), rz(1).

-z
Enable compression (without argument). Archiving and backup programs often use this. Examples: bzip(1), GNU tar(1), zcat(1), zip(1), cvs(1).

The preceding examples are taken from the Linux toolset, but should be good on most modern Unixes.

- How to create .Gitignore rule
1) after creating a .gitignore file
  > touch .gitignore
  > ls -a // you will see folder .gitignore
2) create rules to take out certain files .gitignore file file
  ga-WDI/  // any directory under there none is included "/" signifies directory
  *.mp4 // any file that ends with .mp4
  Video* // any file start with Video in their title
- more refer: https://youtu.be/_vejzukmn4s

- exercise answer: world directory: Carmen Sandiego: world/europe

- terminal command: take me back to home regardless of where we are currently located, will take us to our home folder.
> cd ~ 
> touch joke.txt // create (doesn't overwrites) file
> open joke.txt // open text editor
> mkdir funny_things // make folder (dir) no overwriting

- Moving and Removing things:
Goal: move joke.txt into funny_things directory
> mv joke.txt funny_things/
> mv [source] [destination]
// Move all contents of South_America into the North_America folder.
> mv South_America/* North_America/ 

ex) mv ~/Downloads/*.mp3 ~/Music/  //a number of .mp3 files in your ~/Downloads directory (~/ – is an easy way to represent your home directory – in our earlier example, that would be /home/jack/) and you want them in ~/Music. You could quickly move them with a single command, like so:

* mv command moves specified files or folders to a specified destination.  Note: `mv` command no need -r option to move folder

- copying: cp [original file] [new file]
> cp joke.txt joke2.txt 
// new joke2.txt now in funny_things/ 

- removing: rm joke2.txt
  > rmdir <directoryName> // remove dir if folder empty
resource: https://ss64.com/bash/rmdir.html
  > mv joke.txt jokes/joke.txt // move joke inside jokes folder name it joke.txt
  > rm -r copy_of_jokes // `rm -r` command will remove all of a folder's content, as well as the folder itself.

- adding option ex -r recursive: `cp` command and must apply when - copying folder cp [-r only when dir] [source] [target]
  format option --word or -r (letter shortedn)
  > cp -r copy_of_jokes // only want to copy the folder, we also want to recursively copy the contents of that folder and the contents of any folders inside.

- move world inside your doc folder to root directory
> mv world/ ~/world/  // note: mv folder task no need -r when rm and cp requires for directory

- https://medium.com/the-code-review/top-10-bash-file-system-commands-you-cant-live-without-4cd937bd7df1
8) rm
Removes files and folders rm my_folder . Using -r will again recursively delete subfolders
// Delete South_America directory
> rm -r South_America/
Note: -r required for directory delete

- Rename file or folder
Rename the file apple as orange.doc:
> mv apple orange.doc

- Change the name of the North_America folder to Americas
> mv North_America Americas

- Print your working directory to confirm your location.
> pwd

- List the contents of the Americas folder without changing your working directory (HINT: Use an absolute path)
> ls /Users/Heggy/world/Americas

- Make folder 
mkdir wdi-fundamentals

~ represent home directory

> ~ Heggy$ // Heggy is user name left of the $ sign on command line

> cd desktop/ and enter
what is the working dir?  desktop
/Users/ada/desktop

What was Ada's working directory at the beginning of this terminal session?
> ~ adalovelace$ cd desktop/
> desktop adalovelace$

A) adalovelace is working dir.  /Users/adalovelace/
This is represented by the ~ in the first line of this terminal

> ls
Analytical_Engine.txt
scientific_memoirs.pdf
notes/
// it contains following: 
Analy.txt, scientific.pdf, directory "notes"

> Sanesh-Computer:college sanesh$ rm grocery-list-2005.txt
> Sanesh-Computer:college sanesh$ mv graduation-picture.jpg images-backup/
> Sanesh-Computer:college sanesh$

// deleted file, moved file out of college dir

What command should Shakira use to rename "untitled_essay.doc" to "draft1.doc"?
> mv untitled_essay.doc draft1.doc

- Version Control and Git
Branching: keep track of parallel versions of a project

> git --version // tells version of git

* start git to track
1) go to your working folder
2)
> git init // initialize git

- when you >git init: you have .git directory
`.git/` but you don't see it since it's hidden.  
> ls -a // see the hidden file

ex) git tracking starting
1) Create a directory on our desktop called "GA-Blog"
> mkdir GA-Blog
2) inside "GA-Blog" start git tracking
> cd GA-Blog
> git init 
3) update on the status of our project 
> git status
output: No commits yet, nothing to commit
  this means we have no unsaved changes
  save = Commit

4) Create a new text file post.txt 
> touch post.txt 

- lets check git status
> git status

great terminal commmand bash resource
> man ls
or
https://ss64.com/bash/ls.html

* git knows change has been made but currently doesn't know if we want to save the changes
> git add post.txt // tells git to save post.txt

* The change is *Staged* (added to the list of changes will be saved with next commit).

- To unstage from staged 
> git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage
// unstage post.txt
> git rm --cached post.txt

* To stage (save) all changes to files that have been made inside repo.
> git add . // all changes saved

* saving changes officially
> git commit -m "created a new post.txt file"

Summary: git staging area allows add changes to your project to the local repo.
> git add <file>
> git commit -m "message"

- why 2 step staging?
1) git add 
2) git commit -m
so that each commit changes separately or together (help organize and document)
- Working dir > Staging area > Local repo

- Commit history: SHA (unique tracking for each commit)

- View commit history
> git log
output:

Git Ex)
warning: before doing anything
> git status 
* expected output:
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
// this ensures the dir isn't an already git repo.

- Open your terminal and navigate to the fundamentals directory you created earlier. Create a new directory inside it called git-practice.
> mkdir git-practice
- Use cd to navigate into that new directory; you can make sure you're in the right place by using the pwd command.
> cd git-practice
> pwd
- Use git init to create a Git repository in the git-practice directory.
> git init // create git repo
Note: .git dir exist inside fundamentals/git-practice/
> ls -a // to see any hidden files 
anything starts with . is hidden

- Create a new file README.txt 
> touch README.txt
> git status
// output: git notices untracked file

- run git add README.txt command to add the new file to the staging area. Run git status again — how has the output changed?
> git add README.txt
// move change to staging and knows to save this change

- Happy with changes that you've staged, commit them using git commit -m "...". Give the commit an appropriate message — remember, it should be short but descriptive.
> git commit -m "created README.txt"

- view git commit history
> git log
// SHA unique code shown

- Create a directory: src and add a couple of files to it in "git-practice"
> mkdir git-practice/
> cd git-practice // goes inside git-practice file
> touch sheen.txt gerry.txt // creates multiple files

- Use the add command, but add the src directory instead of the individual files. Use the git status command — see how both files have been staged? Go ahead and commit the addition of these new files to the repo.

> git add src // add src directory note: all the files inside of src gets saved
  new file:   src/mena.txt
	new file:   src/my.txt
	new file:   src/sheen.txt
	new file:   src/yours.txt
- Finaly stagin step 2 commit -m
> git commit -m "Created src dir and children fils"
> git log // see the history

- Make a change to one of the files, and run `git diff` to look at all of the unstaged changes to our repo. What do you see?

- How we can see the changes git diff? Now — without adding or committing — make another change to the same file you changed previously. Look at the status output, and the diff output. See how you can have both staged and unstaged changes, even when you're talking about a single file?
1) create new change to .txt same file
> git diff // status output
> git status // both staged and unstaged changes shown

- Add and commit all outstanding changes. Use the log command to see all of the commits you've made so far.
> git add README.txt // save in staging area
> git commit -m "added info to README" // official send off to local repo
> git log // shows all the commits

- Github workflow:
* fork > cloning > editing > adding/committing > pushing > submit a pull request

- Forking: copy

- practice working remotely
1) fork https://github.com/nodejs/node
forking: making a copy
2) cloning: make a local copy of fork
> cd ~/Document
> git clone https://url-to-clone //copy remote repo via command line

- file system navigation bash terminal path:
* ~ (root directory home /Users/YourName)
> cd ~/Downloads
output: /Users/NAME/Downloads folder
* . current directory
> cd ./Downloads //whatever directory you are on and Downloads
* .. parent directory
> cd .. // go up a level
* / at the beginning of file => root directory

- Pushing github
* changes you made to the code, your local repo will be different from your remote repo
> git push origin master //update your local changes to remote repo

* Github vocabulary:
- origin: shortcut URL of remote repo (repo on on GitHub).  
- master: branch on your remote repo where I add changes.

- Submit pull request: request to owner of code to use your new changes

Review:
- git: a distribu version control sys
- repo: a place data stored and maintained
> git init // create a new repo
- move all your "unstaged" changes — modifications you've made since your last commit — to the staging area?
> git add . // move all changes to staging area
- list of all the commits that have been made in a repo
> git log // history of repo
- Github: a webbased hosting Git repo and offers distr. revision control and source code management functionality that Git offers
- update your remote repository to include the changes you've committed in your local repository
> git push //update your remote repo

### HTML
HTTP is the protocol how computer communicate
- HTML is a markup language HyperText Markup language: 
- elements: building block of html
ex)
<H1> site title 
<H2> 
<a> make up links
href="value" attribute 
href = hyperlink reference
href="#" // place holder url is #
<a href="https://hipsum.co">Read more...</a>
<h3> font bigger than <h6>
- Default name for homepages? index.html

Save any files HTML file in a folder with the appropriate name
ex) index.html for a home page, or about.html for an about page.
- Placeholder for link? 
<a href="#">link</a>

WDI Fundamentals Unit 2
A text-based interface.
Synonyms: command line interface (CLI) console
An OS X application that provides text-based access to a computer's operating system.
Any device or application used for data entry and display in a computer system.
Synonyms: client, computer terminal, terminal emulator
A file system is a systematic way to control how information is stored and retrieved on a
computer. It describes where one piece of information stops and the next one begins. Each file
system has its own structure and logic.
Synonyms: NTFS (Windows' File System), HFS+ (Apple's File System), file allocation table, GFS
(Global File System)
A unit, or container, used to organize computer files into a hierarchical structure.
Synonyms: folder, catalog, drawer
A sequence of symbols and names that identifies a file or directory. The path always starts from
your working directory or from the root directory, and each sub-directory is followed by a forward
slash.
An absolute, or full, path begins with the root directory and specifies every directory above the
terminating file or directory name.
A relative path is a way to specify the location of a directory or file relative to another directory. It
does not include the root or parent directory names.
Synonyms: path name
The action we want the computer to take; always a single word.

Command
Synonyms: utility
Follows the "command" in a command line; used to modify the behavior of the command in
some way.
Synonyms: flag
Follows the "command" and "options" (if any) in a command line and is used to explain what we
want the command to act upon.
The number of arguments used generally depends on the command; some don't need
arguments, some require exactly one argument, some require many arguments, and some are
flexible in the number they can take.
Command Description
pwd ‐options
Prints the working directory; returns the
absolute path name of the current
directory
ls [‐options]
[path/to/directory] Lists directory contents
cd [‐options]
[path/to/directory]
Changes the current working directory to
the specified directory
mkdir [‐options]
[path/to/directory] Makes a new directory
rm ‐r [path/to/file]
[path/to/file] ... Removes directories or files permanently
mv [‐options]
[path/to/file]
[path/to/directory]
Moves directories or files to a new locale
mv [‐options]
[path/to/file]
[NEW_FILE_NAME]
Renames a file or directory
On Mac, your terminal comes with a manual. To access more (a lot more) information about any
command, type man, followed by the command name, and press Enter:
Option
Argument
You can scroll through a manual entry using the arrow keys or space bar. To quit this view and return
to your prompt, type q.
An open-source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the
Linux operating system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is
built on top of.
An individual change to a file (or set of files).
It is similar to saving a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the
"SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who.
Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were
made.
Synonyms: a revision
A diff is the difference in changes between two commits, or saved changes.
The diff will visually describe what was added or removed from a file since its last commit.
The version of something that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. It can be connected
to local clones so that changes can be synced.
Git

Remote
Repository or Repo
The most basic element of Git.
A repository is a project's folder, containing all of the project files (including documentation), and
stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either
public or private.
A personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account.
Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original.
Forks remain attached to the original, allowing you to submit a pull request to the original author
to update with your changes.
A copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere,
or the act of making that copy.
With your clone you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your
changes without having to be online.
It is, however, connected to the remote version so that changes can be synced between the two.
You can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.
Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository such as GitHub.com.
For instance, if you change something locally, you'd want to then push those changes so that
others may access them.
Command Description
git init
Tells Git to start monitoring the current
folder you're in. In other words, for my
working directory, create a new
"timeline" where we can manage our
source code.
git status
Get the current status of Git. Files that
are "staged" (about to be committed),
and files that are unstaged (files that
have changed since the last commit,
but are not about to be committed) will
both show up here
git add
path/to/directory/or/file
Add a file to the "stage". The stage can
be thought of as an in-between state
between the last commit and what is
ready to be committed. Once the
command git commit is run, all staged
files will be committed to the timeline.
Fork
Clone
Push
Command Description
git commit ‐m "Commit
message"
Commit all staged files to the timeline.
If ‐m "Commit messsage" is ommitted, Git
will open your default text editor
(typically Vim) to enter a longer
message. If for any reason Vim is
opened, you can close it by typing :q.
git log
Visualize the timeline. You can scroll
with the arrow keys or j, k, or can exit
by typing q.
git diff
path/to/directory/or/file
Show the tracked but unstaged
changes of the given file or directory.
git clone
http://path/to/repo
Create a new local git repo copied from
a remote one
git push origin master Send local changes to tracked remote
repository
Navigating the Command Line
1) $ cd Downloads 2) $ cd World 3) $ ls 4) $ ls ‐a Europe
Controlling Files with Command Line

1) Command + Space. Inside search bar, type "Terminal." 
2) $ cd Downloads 
3) $ mv World .. will move
to parent directory, in this case the desktop. 
4) $ ../ to move back to the parent directory, then $ ls.
Part 2:
1) $ cd World 2) $ mkdir Antarctica 3) $ ls 4) $ cd World (only if pwd is not World) 5) $ cd South
America $ ls 
6) $ mv Argentina ../North_America 
$ mv Chile ../North_America 
$ mv Brazil ../North_America 

7) $../ (back to World directory)

### css
id is heavy (read last)
class read first

- Class rules will override element selector rules.
- If two classes are applied, the second class will override the first.
- An ID will override both a class and an element selector.
/* Special selectors */

/*pseudo-class secletor*/

a:hover { //when mouse hovers over }
p:first-of-type { // first paragraph }

/*mult selector*/
h1, h2, h3 {  }

/*tag qualified selector*/
p.visible { // less class better  }
.menu.hidden { // use just classes but
  try using single class only }

button#hidden {
  // id by definition it should be only applied to
  one place, id and tag qualified not good redundant
}

/* Descendent selector */
what is wrong with this?
ul li p a { // selecting so many }
better way
.menu-link {  }

.menu li {  // common patter }

/*Direct child selector*/
main > p {   }

/*Adjent Sibling selector*/
- heading and body of text below it
<h2>
<p> // only sibling relationship downward

h2 + p {
  // p must touch right after h2
  if there is another element
}
/*https://codepen.io/heggy231/pen/LqVNpP*/

/*select every tag*/
Star is universal selector
* {
  /* select all tags*/
}

### box model
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/box-model

div {
  width: 40em;
  <!-- margin top/bottom right/left auto makes it center of page  -->
  margin: 4em auto;
}

- Actual width = w + border + padding
except for margin
padding is same as width, height. both (padding, width, height) constrained to content of the element.
padding: space around height and width.
next, up until border.

### flexbox
- 2 solutions flexbox solves:
1) element center vertically and horizontally easily
2) positioning element in the page like footer

1) centering
https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/
<html>
  <body class="parent">
    <div class="child"> Div 1 </div>
  </body>
</html>

body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  margin: 0 auto;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: #990012;
  color: #FFFFFF;
  border-radius: 10px;
  font: 14pt Comic Sans MS;
  text-align: center;
  line-height: 100px;
}

### flexbox works with only direct child of the parent:
// direct child only applies
<body class="parent">
    <div class="child"> Div 1 </div>
// any depth than direct child; not direct doesn't work!
  <body class="parent">
    <div class="child"> <p>how</p>
https://codepen.io/heggy231/pen/yZNoXb?editors=1100

Flex box will span what ever box you put inside

### flex-direction
<main>
  <section>Content 1</section>
  <section>Content 2</section>
  <section>Content 3</section>
</main>

// flexbox
main {
  background: #D3D3D3;

The Viewport Meta Tag!
We've seen some problems that can happen if we don't override some of the initial properties of a website. One of the properties we need to override is the viewport:

### reset to remember:
html 1) 
inside <head>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!-- viewport is the same as the screen, and displays at a natural zoom of 100%. -->

css 2)

### flexbox:
* flex direction row use align item (horizontal related formatting)
* flex direction column use justify-content (vertical)
- flex-direction and flex-wrap combined => flex-flow
#pond {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column wrap;  // shorthand for combo flex-direction and flex-wrap column wrap.
}

* when there is only one line: align-items as whole are aligned within the container (one line)
  when there is multiple lines: align-content: flex-start; // set how multiple lines are spaced apart from each other.
  - when there is only one line, align-content has no effect
  #pond {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-content: flex-start;

### Computation thinking
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/computational-thinking
Computational thinking is a problem-solving process that includes:

- Decomposition: Breaking down data, processes, or problems into smaller, more manageable parts.
- Pattern Recognition: Observing patterns, trends, and regularities in data.
- Abstraction: Identifying the general principles that generate these patterns. This involves filtering out the details we do not need in order to solve a problem.
- Algorithm Design: Developing the step-by-step instructions for solving these and similar problems.

Historically, a recession occurs in the United States every four to seven years. Studying the patterns that lead to recessions is an example of what?
- 

Matt is a first grader. He is asked to describe how to draw a cat. In order to a draw a cat, Matt needs to know that a cat has a tail, fur, and eyes. He does not need to know what sound a cat makes or what a cat likes to eat. What is this an example of?
- 

Carmen is asked to read the poem Fire and Ice by Robert Frost. She is then asked to analyze the meter, rhyme, imagery, structure, tone, diction, and meaning of the poem. What is this an example of?

### JavaScript intro
- backend: front end interacts with your server

  * AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:
    Update a web page without reloading the page
    Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
    Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
    Send data to a server - in the background

    AJAX is not a programming language.
    AJAX is a technique for accessing web servers from a web page.
    AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

  * how to hook js to your file

## const vs let
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/data-types-and-variables#const
const
const is short for "constant". It literally means, "declaring a variable that will be constant." So, a const can't be reassigned. If I assign a const to a primitive type (e.g. a string, number, or boolean), I can't change its value at all.

const hi = 'hello';
hi = 'goodbye'; // this line will throw an error because I attempted to change
// the reference to a const.
Try to use const whenever possible to maintain predictability.

But!
Just to make it a little trickier, this does not mean that a const is immutable. JavaScript assigns by reference. This means that a variable can't be reassigned entirely, but we can change a property of an object or add an item to an array. If I assign an object literal as a const variable like this:

const anObject = {
	hi: 'hello',
	animal: 'muffin'
};

- let is useful inside loop since i's value keep changing
Object name const!

- Data Types
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/data-types-and-variables#intro-to-new-material-data-types
* JS loosely typed language- assign variable (use null)
Modulus random number generator: assign to 1user or 2user, a|b testing 

* string interpolation:
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/data-types-and-variables#syntax-guidelines

let name = "Heggy";
let greet = "hi";
undefined
`${greet} ${name}`
"hi Heggy"
function greeting () {
	return `Hello ${name}`;

}

greeting()
"Hello Heggy"
name = "jaylo";
greeting();
"Hello jaylo"
// backtick operates as string, string interpolation ${}

- num = 14 => num++ 14 
num is first assigned 14 and adds 1 
new num is 15

- Math.floor(Math.random()*10) 
random 0 - 9 

Math.random()
range 0–1 (inclusive of 0, but not 1)

- you can sanitize string of user input
'hello'.toLowerCase();

### Converting Numbers to Strings
If you want to turn a number into a string you can use a helpful method called toString().
(1).toString()
=> '11'
/**
be careful though,
since numbers can be floats
javascript might
misunderstand you.
*/
1.toString()
=> Float Error
// but the following works
1..toString()

- buttons { display: inline-block; }


## Type coercion
1 == "1"  //implicit coversion latter value starts from left and it looks at the value and convert the check for the value from left side then coherse to string first
== just checks for the value 

0 == false // true 0 is always false!
0 === false // 0 is always false!

7 === 7 // true
7 === "7" // false
0 === false // false
false === "false" // false
false === false // true
7 !== 7 // false
7 !== "7" // true
0 !== false // true
false !== "false" // true

Truthy
Something is truthy when it can be coerced into the Boolean value true. In JavaScript, truthy values include:
"abc" (any non-empty string)
-1, 1, 2.5 (any non-zero number)
true
Falsey
Something is falsey when it can be coerced into the Boolean value false. The falsey category of values includes:

false
0 (zero)
"" (empty string)
null
undefined
NaN (a special Number value meaning "Not a Number"!)

"apple" && true && 1 // 1 - it evaluates until the very last one since all it true goes to the first
!!"" // false
1 && true && "" // "" - empty string is false 
!!(1 && true && "") // false
1 && true && "" && 0 // ""
1 && true && "" && false // ""
!!"" // false
short circuit, guard expression - it guards you to going to the next expression

0 && "potato"
0
false && "potato"
false
0 && "potato"
0
1 && "potato"
"potato"

true || "kiwi" // true if all is true returns the first true value
1 || "kiwi" // 1 it stops as soon as you see the first true value

/*

// But what if I'd also settle for any make/model of bicycle, from any year, if the price was right (which is to say, free)? Is there a way I could incorporate that into my expression in a single line? There sure is!

// Price is the most important factor, so let's address that first!
price === 0 || make === "Schwinn" && model === "Collegiate" && year < 1985 && year >= 1975 && price <= 125.25

numbers.reduce(getSum);

array.map(); // shallow copy leaves the original alone
Map each value in the array to a new value using the provided callback.
The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

var array1 = [1, 4, 9, 16];
// pass a function to map
const map1 = array1.map(x => x * 2);
console.log(map1);
// expected output: Array [2, 8, 18, 32]

## DRY function 
* Performance: Having repeated code will lead to longer scripts. Longer scripts take up more memory and will take more time to load, which can make a website seem slow.

* Maintainability - how easily can you update your code.  if I want one function change, it is easy to just change one single place

function expression defines a function by producing a value that's stored in a variable.
  var heggFun = function () { //code block };

- how to call function catTalk
var catTalk = function() {
	console.log("Meow");
}
undefined
catTalk();

what is wrong with this function? it is not scalable
  let area = function () {
    let width = 5;
    let length = 3;
    console.log(`area: ${width * length}`);
  };

  area();

  var area = function (width, length) {
    console.log(`area: ${width * length}`);
    console.log(width);
  };

  area(3, 5);  
  we can't have access to width sinc it is scoped inside function.

- Exercise: - Disney
Create a function named disney.
It should accept two parameters, villain and movie.
The function should take the parameters and log the result to the console saying "{villain} is the meanest character in {movie}."
Now call that function, passing in Ursula and The Little Mermaid as the arguments.
Check the console to make sure the correct sentence is displayed!

var disney = function (villain, movie) {
	console.log(`${villain} is the meanest character in ${movie}.`);
};

disney("Ursula" , "The Little Mermaid");


var area = function (width, length) {
	return width * length;
}

var calcArea = area(3, 3);
console.log(`this is area ${calcArea}`);
VM4788:12 this is area 9

### arrow function 
function addTwo(num) {
  return num + 2;
}

var addTwo = num => {
	return num + 2;
}

function multply (x, y) {
	return x * y;
}

var multply = (x, y) => {
	return x * y;
}

#### Do you remember `const`?
Anything that was a `var` in ES6 is better practice to write as a `let` or a `const`.
You can write functions using `const` or `let` as well. This can be helpful to know that the function's assignment later cannot change (in the case of `const`) or explicitly declared as can (in the case of `let`). Using `let` or `const` with a function is not necessary, but in some cases it's good practice (more on that later).

So now with the arrow syntax, we had:
```javascript
var addTwo = num => {
  return num + 2;
}

const addTwo = num => {
  return num + 2;
}

- Another thing to note is that if the function does nothing except a return, we can simplify it even further. All of these function declarations are valid:

// traditional
function addTwo(num) {
  return num + 2;
}

// arrow syntax
const addTwo = num => {
  return num + 2;
}

// now even further simplified
const addTwo = num => num + 2;
// note that we dropped the curly braces and return keyword

- arrow function is anonymous. it returns value.
// basic function, adds 2 to a parameter num passed in
function addTwoFunction(num) {
  return num + 2;
}

// arrow function with explicit return value, adds 4 to a parameter num passed in
const addFourArrowFunction = num => {
  return num + 4;
}

// arrow function with implicit return value, adds 6 to a parameter num passed in. No curly braces necessary since it only returns - thus, an "implicit return" arrow function.
const addSixConcisely = num => num + 6;

var disney = function (villain, movie) {
	console.log(`${villain} is the meanest character in ${movie}.`);
};
var disney = (villain, movie) => console.log(`${villain} is the meanest character in ${movie}.`);
disney("Ursula" , "The Little Mermaid");

var area = function  {
	return width * length;
}
var area = (width, length) => width * length; // note that we dropped the curly braces and return keyword
var calcArea = area(3, 3);
console.log(`this is area ${calcArea}`); 

- scope: 
Variables in JavaScript are scoped - or track values - either globally or within an entire function. Since var in JavaScript is scoped to the nearest parent function, it can be pretty unpredictable, right?

function varTest() {
  var x = 1;
  if (true) {
    var x = 2;  // same variable!
    console.log(x);  // Prints 2
  }
  console.log(x);  // This is going to print 2!
}
varTest();

### loops

let z = 0;

let myStr = "Bar";

while (z < 5) {
	myStr += "X";
	z += 1;
	console.log(myStr);
}
---- https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/js-loops-iterators

while (let z < 5) {
	myStr += "X";
	z += 1;
	console.log(myStr);

Independent Practice: Fizz Buzz
Fizz Buzz is a game about division. Create a program that will iterate through numbers from 1 to 101 and log each number in the console.

In the loop, every time a number is divisible by 3, instead of logging the number itself, the word "fizz" should appear.
If the number is divisible by 5, the word "buzz" should be logged.
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, then the word "fizzbuzz" should be logged.

function fizzbuzz(num) { // wrong

	for (var i = 1; i <= 101; i++) {
		if (num % 3 === 0) {
			console.log("fizz");
		} else if(num % 5 === 0) {
			console.log("buzz");
		} else if(num % 15 === 0) {
			console.log("fizzbuzz");
		} else {
			console.log(i);
		}

	}

} // wrong!

- retry fizzbuzz
function fizzbuzz() { //wrong

	for (var i = 1; i <= 101; i++) {
		if (i % 3 === 0) {
			console.log("fizz");
		} else if(i % 5 === 0) {
			console.log("buzz");
		} else if(i % 15 === 0) {
			console.log("fizzbuzz");
		} else {
			console.log(i);
		}

	}

}
fizzbuzz();

- 15 didn't work retry with narrowest condition first
function fizzbuzz() { // right!!

	for (var i = 1; i <= 101; i++) {
		if (i % 15 === 0) {
			console.log("fizzbuzz");
		} else if(i % 5 === 0) {
			console.log("buzz");
		} else if(i % 3 === 0) {
			console.log("fizz");
		} else {
			console.log(i);
		}

	}

}
fizzbuzz();

	var At = j;
	for (i = j + 1; i < arr.length; i++){

### DOM (https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/dom-manipulation)
Document is different class vs document
document.querySelector('.special')

https://css-tricks.com/dom/

<ul>
	<li id="red">Red</li>
	<li id="blue">Blue</li>
	<li id="yellow">Yellow</li>
</ul>
document.getElementById('red');
<li id=​"red">​Red​</li>​

How could we use the querySelector method to do the following:

Select the first list item on the page?
Select the element that has the id yellow?
Select the ul ?
( Answers: 1.document.querySelector('li') 2. document.querySelector('#yellow') 3. document.querySelector('ul') )


- Selecting Multiple Elements

document.getElementsByClassName('special');
document.querySelectorAll('li')[4];
  element tagname 
  element class .
  element id #

- Note: even though node in DOM looks like array but forEach or looping doesn't work.

### Manipulating the DOM - Adding Elements 3 steps!
    https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/dom-manipulation#manipulating-the-dom---adding-elements
To add new elements to the page, we'll need to use a three-step process:
```markdown
>
1) We will use the createElement() method to create a new element, which can then be added to the page. When this node is created, it will be empty. This element will be stored in a variable.
2)Next, we will add content to the element using the innerHTML or textContent properties.
3)Now that our element has been created, we can add it as a child of an element using the appendChild() method. This will add an element as the last child of the parent element.
To add a fourth item to our list, we can execute the following code:



Ground work for adding appending element
Updating Content — innerHTML
Let's start with innerHTML.

We can use the innerHTML property to get and set content for an element.

For example, if we want to change the HTML content for the first <li>, we could execute the following:

document.getElementsByTagName('li')[0].innerHTML = 'Email <a href="mom@gmail.com">Mom</a>';
innerHTML would change the HTML content of the first <li> to Email <a href="mom@gmail.com">Mom</a>.



If we simply want to retrieve the HTML content to use later on, we can grab it and save it in a variable, like so:
```javascript
  var firstListItem = document.getElementsByTagName('li')[0].innerHTML;
```
- Updating Content — textContent
Now, let's turn our attention to the concept of textContent.

This property allows us to get and set the text content for an element. For example:

document.getElementById('important').textContent = 'Done!'
This code would change the text content of the <li> that has the id important to 'Done!'.

Compare and Contrast: textContent vs. innerHTML
So how do innerHTML and textContent differ? When we are setting content with textContent, any HTML will be displayed as text:

document.querySelector('p').textContent = "Visit my <a href='http://www.example.com'>Site</a>";
In contrast, when setting content by updating the innerHTML property, any HTML tags will be inserted into the page as actual HTML content, not just text:

document.querySelector('p').innerHTML = "Visit my <a href='http://www.example.com'>Site</a>";

// First up, let's create a new list
// item and store it in a variable.
var newListItem = document.createElement('li');

// Alright, now let's update the
// text content of that list item.
newListItem.textContent = 'Feed the cat';

// And finally, let's add that list
// item as a child of the ul.
document.getElementsByTagName('ul')[0].appendChild(newListItem);

Independent Practice: What is an Event?
      While DOM is listening it will register via clicking hovering scrolling over an element key-up/down click anything user stiking of key, with mouse
      
      But first, a question for you: What is an event (on a webpage)? Spend two minutes doing the following tasks. You are encouraged to discuss your findings with a partner during the exercise.

Come up with your own definition without looking at any other sources. Don't worry about getting it right — what do you think an event is?
Now, find (i.e., Google) some documentation on JavaScript events. Does that information match your definition? How would you change it?
Write down three examples of an event.

#### event listener setting:
element.addEventListener('nameOfEvent', functionToRun);
'nameOfEvent' - click, hover blur event
  // DO not add functionToRun()  <= since it is function expression as a reference
  0) element - Refers to the DOM node with which we want to tie the event. For example, if we want to trigger an event when the user clicks on a button, the element would be that button element.
  1) .addEventListener() - This is the method we will use to tie an event listener to an element.
  2) 'nameOfEvent' - This is the event we want to listen to. For example, maybe we want to wait until the user triggers a 'click' event.
  3) 'functionToRun' - This is the name of the function we want to run when the event occurs. When we pass a function as an argument to another function (as we are here), this is what is referred to as a callback function.
    - Note that there are no parentheses after the function name.
      * functionToRun not functionToRun().
      * If we were to include (), we invoke the function expression immediately, not after the user interacts with the page.
      * Without the (), we're using the function expression as a reference.

- order matter
// order matter! if you bring it down it stops working!!!
var alertUser = function () {
  alert('Button has been clicked!');
}

var button = document.querySelector('button');

button.addEventListener('click', alertUser);

### Object (constructors, prototypes, oop, class)
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/js-objects

- They act as a simple, structured data store. And, while they are similar to arrays, they access values using keys instead of indices.
- They provide a fundamental programming paradigm that helps us structure and categorize code. We'll explore this programming paradigm, known as Object Oriented Programming, in a future lesson.
  oop: more scalable, obje is more like a real world. 
    think Facebook made out of obj
      - user, newsfeed, groups, post, photos
      JS is not strict object language.  it can be functional and also object can co-exist
      - JS is procedural, functional, obj langurage (java is strictly oop since all is wrap inside of obj)

- 2ways to access property
var superHero = {
  firstName: "Tony",
  lastName: "Stark",
  superHeroName: "IronMan",
  revealIdentity: function() {
    console.log(`run! heggy the ${this}`);
  }
}

superHero.revealIdentity();
  -  dot notation vs bracket notation
     superHero["revealIdentity"](); // parenthesis to run the method

var superHero = {
  firstName: "Tony",
  lastName: "Stark",
  superHeroName: "IronMan",
  revealIdentity: function() {
    console.log(`run! heggy the ${this}`);
  }
}

let name = "firstName";
superHero[name]; // when using name variable access using bracket noation
// "Tony"

- use bracket notation
var pet = {
  species: 'iguana',
  gender: 'female',
  age: 12,
  name: 'Godzilla'
};

  pet["name"]
  pet["age"] = 13;
How would you retrieve the value for name from the object, and store this value in a variable petName using square bracket syntax [ ]?
How would you assign 13 as the value for age using square bracket syntax [ ]?
How would you add a new key, favoriteFood, with value 'crickets' using square bracket syntax [ ]?
  pet["favFood"] = "lamb";

- delete 
delete object.property      // Dot notation
delete object['property']   // Square bracket syntax

var superHero = {
  firstName: "Tony",
  lastName: "Stark",
  superHeroName: "IronMan",
  revealIdentity: function() {
    console.log(`run! heggy the ${this}`);
  }
}

delete superHero.revealIdentity
// delete is a method on obj that deletes key value property inside obj

- Iterating through an Object (for..in loop)
  // Iterate through object keys and print out all obj's key
  for (attribute in superman) {
    console.log( attribute );
  }

- .keys()
JavaScript objects also have native methods that take care of this for us...

var superHero = {
  firstName: "Tony",
  lastName: "Stark",
  superHeroName: "IronMan",
  revealIdentity: function() {
    console.log(`run! heggy the ${this}`);
  }
}
// .keys()
Object.keys(superman);
Object.keys() returns an array of object keys.
  Object.keys(pet).forEach(); // access each element inside my array

Object.entries(superman) // Object.entries() returns a list of key, value pairs.
  (4) [Array(2), Array(2), Array(2), Array(2)]
  0: (2) ["firstName", "Tony"]
  1: (2) ["lastName", "Stark"]
  2: (2) ["superHeroName", "IronMan"]
  3: (2) ["revealIdentity", ƒ]

- Nested Collections
var car = {
  make: "Honda",
  model: "Civic",
  year: 1997,

  // An array within an object.
  gears: ["Reverse", "Neutral", "1", "2", "3", "4"],

  // An object within an object.
  engine: {
    horsepower: "6 horses",
    pistons: 12,
    fast: true,
    furious: false
  }
};
car.engine.horsepower
// "6 horses"

Check: In the above examples, how do we access...

"Neutral" (i.e., array value within an object)?
"6 horses" (i.e., object value within an object)?
> car.gears[0]
// "Reverse"

- excercise obj for in 
Exercise:
Create a variable named wdiStudent and assign it to an object literal.

Give your student at least three properties.
One must contain an array or object.
Update two properties, using square bracket notation to update one and dot notation to update the other.
Give your student a new property using dot or bracket notation.
Delete one attribute.
Iterate through and print out all of the student's key-value pairs.
Bonus: Write a function that returns your wdiStudent object.

var wdiStudent = {
  name: 'Charlie Kelly',
  squad: 'Paddys',
  classesTaken: ['git intro', 'cli', 'css' ],
  numberOfTardies: 0,
  favoriteFood: 'Milksteak',
  enrolled: true,
  hobby: 'Magnet'
}

// Update two existing properties
wdiStudent['numberOfTardies'] += 1;
wdiStudent.classesTaken.push('js-basics');

// Add a new property
wdiStudent.roommate = 'Frank';

// Delete one attribute
delete wdiStudent.hobby;

// Iterate through and log key-value pairs
for (attr in wdiStudent){
  console.log('The key ' + attr + ' has the value ' + wdiStudent[attr]);
}

var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Lemon", "Apple", "Mango"];

undefined
// extract second and third element
var citrus = fruits.slice(1, 3);
undefined
citrus
(2) ["Orange", "Lemon"]

// ["git intro", "cli", "css"] extract second
wdiStudent.classesTaken.slice(1,2);

function myObj (studObj) {
  console.log(studObj);

Creating Object Instances (use new keyword)
1) create the base: (constructor)
var Superhero = function () {};

2) make kids base off of constructor 
var clark = new Superhero();
var bruce = new Superhero();

- The constructor function is called at the moment that our new object is instantiated.

For example:

var Superhero = function () {
  console.log('Superhero instance created');
};

var clark = new Superhero();
=> "Superhero instance created"

var bruce = new Superhero();
=> "Superhero instance created"

  }
}

var wolfman = new Pet('Wolfman', 'cat', 'Tuxedo Cat', 'meow');
var rover = new Pet('Rover', 'dog', 'Golden Retriever', 'bark');

    this.bloom = function() {   // method reside each object that gets created
        console.log("Look at me!");

- Adding Methods to our Flower Object
Using a prototype will enable us to easily define methods to all instances created by a constructor function while saving memory. What's great is that the method will only be applied to the prototype of the object, so it is only stored in the memory once, because objects coming from the same constructor point to one common prototype object.

By adding the method bloom to the constructor's prototype, we can enable all flowers to share a bloom method, or any other method for that matter!

function Flower (color, petals, smells) {
    this.color = color;
    this.petals = petals;
    this.smells = smells;
};

Flower.prototype = {
  bloom: function() {
    console.log("Look at me!");
  }
};

- Create a wilt() method that decrements each flower by one petal. :(
  Flower.prototype.wilt = function () {
    this.petals += -1;
    console.log(this.petals);
  };

- classes in JS: class is not hoisted uptop therefore needs to follow the code order
// first make class
class Flower {}
// then call class
const flower = new Flower();

- Post ES6 classes are defined in JavaScript. These are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance.

class Flower {
	constructor(color, petals, smells){
		this.color = color;
		this.petals = petals;
		this.smells = smells;
	}
}


class Cat extends Animal{
	constructor(name, isDomestic){
		//calls constructor(name, type="unknown")
		// function Animal name and type we can use it here!
		super(name, 'carnivore');
		this.isDomestic = isDomestic;
	}

	// creating my own method
	caBeDomesticated(){
		return this.isDomestic;
	}

	// extend original method further and add custome method applies only cat
	speak(){
		// super allows us to traverse the chain up
		super.speak();
		console.log(`${this.name}` meows);
	}

  var snake = new Animal("Steven", "Reptile");
undefined
var cat = new Cat("Wilbur");
cat.isDomestic = true;

*** A Developer's Guide to Google Fu: ***
Copy and paste the exact text of your error into Google, and then remove any words that are specific to your script.

For example, instead of:
Uncaught ReferenceError: robins_spatula is not defined
...search for:

Uncaught ReferenceError: is not defined
If you're looking for a specific phrase, put it in quotes.

is not defined will return any page with the words is, not, and defined.
"is not defined" will return any page with the exact phrase is not defined.
Use - to exclude stuff.

ReferenceError -jquery will return any page with ReferenceError and without jquery.
Use site:sitename.com to search within a site

site:stackoverflow.com ReferenceError will search for pages with ReferenceError inside Stack Overflow only.

### jquery
- 3rd week: https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/jquery-vs-javascript
** benefit of jQuery:
- cross browser compatiablity

  ex) 
  "fallback" code still allows us to access the event object in IE 5-8
    if(!e) {
      e = window.event;
    }

    e.preventDefault();

    document.querySelector('.message').style.display = 'block';

** JavaScript
First, let's change the class name of the li to task-complete.

> document.getElementsByTagName('li')[0].className = 'task-complete';
Then, let's change the background color of the li to blue.

> document.getElementsByTagName('li')[0].style.backgroundColor = "blue";

** jQuery
We can change the class name of the li to task-complete and the background color to blue — all in one line of code!

> $('li').addClass('task-complete').css('background-color', 'blue');

- javaScript
  * less magic (control of every feature)
  * better performance
  * faster: naitive code

vs - jQuery
  * Write less code to achieve the same task
  * crx-browser compatibility
  * more familiar, css-style syntax

  $( "#blog div" ) id blog > div 

  $( ".alert" )

$( "#signup-form" )

$( "#blog div" )

$( ".post h2" )

// Yes, you can use CSS pseudo-selectors to select DOM elements!
$( "div:nth-child(2)" ) // select second child

// You can also select by HTML attribute.
// Format: tag + [ attributeName='attributeValue' ]
// Take note of single quotation marks.
$( "img[ src='img/5.jpeg' ]" )


- Open the Blawg index.html file in Chrome and try the following snippets in your console. What's the difference between [] and .eq()?
   $("h2")[1] will just give you the selected element
   $("h2").eq(1) give you jquery function, and its context such as prevObj

1) All <a> elements on the page.
  console.log($("a"));
2) The first <a> element on the page.
  $("a:first")
3) Using an id, the <h1> at the top of the page.

4) All elements with class post.
  $(".post")
5) The first element with class post.

6) The second element with class post.

7) The HTML content of the first <a> element on the page.


Things to consider:

What's the difference between $("body").html() and $("body").html("hello")?
  - $("body").html() gives you back the entire html body 
  - $("body").html("hello") function and it prev. objct

jquery resource:

- first step to jquery 
$( document ).ready(function() {
 
    // Your code here.
 
});

/*<ul id="myList">
		<li>2</li>
		<li>3</li>
		<li>4</li>
</ul>

*/

// 1. When the user's mouse enters' #trigger
	// a) Add a <li> to the beginning of #myList that contains the text "1"
	// b) Add a <li> to the end of #myList that contains the text "5"
$('#trigger').mouseenter(function() {
  $( "#myList" ).append( "<li>14</>" );
});

- Ajax jquery

https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/jquery-ajax-apis
* API definition:  
"An application-programming interface (API) is a set of programming instructions and standards for accessing a Web-based software application or Web tool.

Pyment: stripe, 

- AJAX: a phone that helps us to make the call
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/jquery-ajax-apis#intro-to-ajax
* AJAX definition:  stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.'
Asynchronous is a term used to describe a non-blocking process. This means that, when we're making updates, we can load data into part of a page without having the whole page refresh.

AJAX call steps: 
  1) *method* This will take the value "GET" if we want to request data from a server, and "POST" if we want to send data that updates on a server.

  $.ajax({
      method: "GET"
  });

  POST: Send data

2) *url* The URL setting defines the page where we'll send the request.

$.ajax({
      method: "GET",
      url: "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q="
});

  3) *data* Next, we have the data setting, which allows you to send additional data to the server along with the request.

  $.ajax({
      method: "GET",
      url: "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=",
      data: {
          id: 123
      }
  });

4) *success* Next, we have the success setting, which runs if the request is successfully completed.

```javascript
$.ajax({
  method: "GET",
  url: "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=",
  data: {
    id: 123
},
  success: function( response ) {
    $('#temp').html("The temperature in Detroit is " + response.temp);
  }
});
```

5) *error* The error setting will run a function if there is an error with the request.

 $.ajax({
 	method: "GET",
 	url: "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=",
 	data: {
 	  	id: 123
 	},
 	success: function( response ) {
 	  	$('#temp').html("The temperature in Detroit is " + response.temp);
 	},
 	error: function() { // error response!
 	  	alert("There was an error getting weather data.");
 	}
 });

6) *before* Send We can use the beforeSend setting to run code before the request is sent.

  $.ajax({
  	method: 'GET',
  	url: 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=',
  	data: {
  	  id: 123
  	},
  	success: function( response ) {
  	  $('#temp').html('The temperature in Detroit is ' + response.temp);
  	},
  	error: function() {
  	  alert('There was an error getting weather data.');
  	},
  	beforeSend: function () {
  	  $('#page').append('Loading');
  	}
  });

7) *complete* And finally, we can use the complete setting to run a function after the request is complete.

$.ajax({
      method: 'GET',
      url: 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=',
      data: {
        id: 123
      },
      success: function( response ) {
        $('#temp').html('The temperature in Detroit is ' + response.temp);
      },
      error: function() {
        alert('There was an error getting weather data.');
      },
      beforeSend: function () {
        $('#page').append('Loading');
      },
      complete: function () {
        $('#loading').remove();
      }
});

* interview question: 2/6/2019
- DoctType 5: if you do'nt put doctType 5 is it going to work? yes
- HTML Tags: sibling selector types of selectors what those things they will select
- default position property: it is relative
- document ready function? $( document ).ready() will only run once the page Document Object Model (DOM) is ready for JavaScript code to execute. it is eventlistner waiting for document to get ready trigger the ready event. run after body is ready to go?
  alternative to document.ready(): put <script> tag right before </body>
  why do we use $(document).ready(…) ?

  $(document).ready is an event which fires up when document is ready.

  Suppose you have placed your jQuery code in head section and trying to access a dom element (an anchor, an img etc), you will not be able to access it because html is interpreted from top to bottom and your html elements are not present when your jQuery code runs.

  To overcome this problem, we place every jQuery/javascript code (which uses DOM) inside $(document).ready function which gets called when all the dom elements can be accessed.

  And this is the reason, when you place your jQuery code at the bottom (after all dom elements, just before </body>) , there is no need for $(document).ready

  There is no need to place on method inside $(document).ready only when you use on method on document because of the same reason I explained above.

** how does md-10 offset-1 is centering? (https://tutorialzine.com/2015/10/learn-the-bootstrap-grid-in-15-minutes)
  6. To create margins on the left of columns we can use the offset classes. Applying a .col-md-offset-2 class to any column will move it to the right, as if there is an invisible .col-md-2 cell there. You can have different offsets for the different screen sizes thanks to the xs, sm, md and lg prefixes.

  Some specs to use offsets to easily center columns:

  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3"></div>
      <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"></div>
  </div>

### how to set up express
** Prep for express install) **
> touch server.js
> npm init // since you have one file server.js it knows to create it as entry point
> npm install express --save
1. Create a `server.js` file and add this basic hello world code:

  ```js
    // server.js
    // SERVER-SIDE JAVASCRIPT
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();

    // Allow CORS: we'll use this today to reduce security so we can more easily test our code in the browser.  COR
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
      res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
      res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
      next();
    });

    app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'));

    app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000,  () => console.log('Example app listening at http://localhost:3000/'));
  ```
2. Add a comment above each line of code saying what each line does.

  > **Hint**: Reference [the express documentation](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app).
  > **Hint**: `process.env.PORT || 3000` means "in production use the production port, otherwise use 3000 (for development)".

3. Run `node server.js` in the Terminal. You should see 'Example app listening at http://localhost:3000/' _in the Terminal_.  When we're using express, this is where our server-side console logs show up!  Also, visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser. You should see "Hello World!"  The browser console only shows client-side console outputs. **Every time you make a change in your server code and want it to run, you need to end the previous server and run `node server.js`**.

4. Console log the `req` (request) and the `res` (response) objects inside your server code's `app.get` method for the `/` path. (The `/` path is often called the "root" path.) Restart the server and briefly check out what the `req` and `res` are.


**Add Some Data on the Server**

1. In server.js, add some starter data  (often called "seed data") to serve when the users visit '/api/albums'.

  ```js
    // server.js
    const albums = [
      {
        title: 'Cupid Deluxe',
        artist: 'Blood Orange'
      },
      {
        title: 'M3LL155X - EP',
        artist: 'FKA twigs'
      },
      {
        title: 'Fake History',
        artist: 'letlive.'
      }
    ];
  ```

2.  To have this data be accessible, we'll need to set up a route to serve it. Add an `app.get` method for the path `/api/albums`.  Inside the new route, use `res.json(albums)` to respond with some JSON containing all the albums from our albums variable.

  > Restart your server, and you should see our albums when you use postman to request the `http://localhost:3000/api/albums` URL.  You could also try using curl: `curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/albums` or just your browser.

**Request Data From the Server**

1. Let's get this working with our index page now.  In your browser, open `index.html` and then open the javascript console.  You should see 'Sanity Check: JS is working!'  Try running the following AJAX request in the JavaScript console:

  ```js
  $.ajax({
     method: 'GET',
     url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/albums',
     success: handleSuccess,
     error: handleError
   });

   const handleSuccess = json =>  console.log(json);

   const handleError = (xhr, status, errorThrown) => console.log('uh oh');

  ```
  > Note: you must be on a page with jQuery in order to use .ajax in the browser console!  Fortunately, the included index.js does have jQuery.

  You should get something back like:
  ```
  [Object, Object, Object]
  ```
  Dig into those and see what they look like.

2. Next edit `app.js` to run the same ajax call as above and console log the data.  Remember to put your ajax call inside the handler for the document ready event: `$(document).ready(function() {})`. Consider moving the success handling function definition outside the ajax call, since it's about to get more complicated!

3. Once you have that, edit `app.js` to display this data on your `index.html` page using jQuery.  Decide how you want it to look.  **Hint:** You might also find it useful to edit `index.html`!

4. Restart your server and refresh the page. You should see a list of album titles on the page.

**Serve our index page**

At this point, `server.js` and our client-side files (`index.html`, `app.js`, and `styles.css`) are only connected by the ajax request made in `app.js`. Let's make a route to serve our `index.html`.  We're just going to serve the index on the route GET `/` for now.

1. First let's be sure we follow a good convention for file location and directory structure. This will help a lot when organizing larger projects.  Move `index.html` into a new `views` directory. (Create the directory first.)

  _A good express file tree structure_:

  ```
  ├── server.js  // your server code
  ├── package.json    // project info and dependencies; changed by npm init or npm install --save somePackage
  ├── public  // i.e. client-side
  │   ├── images  // images to serve to client
  │   ├── scripts  // or js
  │       └── app.js   // client-side javascript file
  │   └── styles // or css
  │       └── styles.css
  ├── vendor // an optional 2nd public directory that includes jQuery & bootstrap if we choose not to use a CDN
  └── views  // html files that we'll serve
  │   ├── index.html
  ```

2. We're just going to serve our index on the root route, `/`, so change the current GET `/` route from serving the string `'hello world'` to instead sending the `index.html` file, with `res.sendFile('views/index.html' , { root : __dirname});`. Curious about what this does? Try logging `__dirname` to your console.

  > If you restart your server now and visit 'localhost:3000' in the browser, you'll notice the site now shows the contents of the html file instead of just the hello world message! Congratulations; you now have a server serving a page!

  > But the page looks a little different than when we just opened it as a file, and you'll see some errors in the console.  That's because we're not yet serving the js and css files the page needs.  Let's fix that next.

**Add Static Files (CSS, JS, Images)**

1. Make a directory in your project called `public`; then create `public/scripts`, `public/styles` and `public/images` subdirectories.  Move `styles.css`, and `app.js`, into their public subdirectories.  These files are called static files. (You can delete the old directories they were in.)

2. Set up the express app to serve the static files (actually, the whole public directory.)

  ```js
    // server.js
    app.use(express.static('public'));
  ```

3. Get a `console.log("Sanity Check: JS is working!")` from your `app.js` to appear in your browser dev tools console.

4. Get the css styles in `styles.css` working again on the index page.

5. Everything should be working again now, and you should see your albums when you visit `localhost:3000`.  If not, fix it!

**Challenge**

We're making a weird app. Albums and taquerias.  Treat your senses.  

1. Add some taqueria seed data to your server file.

  ```js
    // server.js
    const taquerias = [
      { name: "La Taqueria" },
      { name: "El Farolito" },
      { name: "Taqueria Cancun" }
    ];
  ```

2. Add a route to your server side javascript that clients can use to get taqueria data.  The route's path should be `/api/taquerias`.  Instead of `res.send` (for simple strings) or `res.sendFile`, this route will use `res.json`.


  ```js
    app.get('/api/taquerias', (req, res) => res.json(taquerias));
  ```

3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/api/taquerias (remember to restart your server first!) and check that the data is showing up.


4. In your `app.js` file, write a jQuery AJAX request to get the taqueria data. When the response comes back, display all the taqueria names above the albums on your site's root page (localhost:3000/).  

  <details><summary> Want a reminder of the ajax call structure? Click here!</summary>

  ```js
  $.ajax({
    method: 'GET',
    url: '/api/taquerias',
    success: handleResponse
  });

  const handleResponse = (json) => {
    // your code here
  }
  ```

  </details>

### Stretch Challenges

1. Add a `vendor` folder to your project. The `vendor` folder is traditionally used for third-party (external) library code.  Download Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript files and add them to the `vendor` folder. Can you include Bootstrap in your project from this location instead of the CDN? What is the benefit of having a separate `vendor` folder for external front-end libraries?

  > **Hint**: Remember to serve the static vendor files to make them available to your front end.

  ```js
    // server.js
    app.use(express.static('vendor'));
  ```

2. Add an image to your `public/images` folder and display it in `index.html`.

### MongoDB - DocumentDB (NoSQL) - nonRelational
If you want to add a property: you can add property only for one object.
- why are you keep working with SQL db still here?
  * Relational database is better accuracy. banking info is always use relational db.
  * ACID property of SQL database. - if I am w/d amount from bank account, that outlet should
    be only exist.  transaction has to go through completely to give back the response.

- FullStack application overview:
  1) Client (frontEnd: html, css, JS, JQuery) sends request to serve 
  2)server (local server port 3000: NodeJS server using ExpressJS)
    Handling a request: CRUD appGet login
  3) Database: stores user, info persists
    Mongoos translates what server is saying to Database. (ORM obj relational Mapping)

    1) create a blueprint
    const ContactSchema = new Schema({
    firstName: String,
    lastName: String,
    address: String,
    phoneNumber: Number,
    email: String,
    professionalContact: Boolean
    });

    2) get an access:
    const Contact = mongoose.model('Contact', ContactSchema);

Make a project directory and server.js:
mkdir todo_app
cd todo_app
touch server.js
Use npm init to create a package.json:
npm init
Install Express and open the project directory in your text editor:
npm install express

code .
Now, assuming you already have MongoDB installed (you did this at installfest), to get started using mongoose in a project, we have to install it to add it to a project's package.json:
  npm i mongoose
Next we need to require Mongoose in our project and connect to the MongoDB service (it could be local or hosted). We can do this in server.js, or separate the code a little more by using a models directory and connecting everything in models/index.js.
  const mongoose = require('mongoose');
  mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/todo-app', { useNewUrlParser: true } );

> Finally, we need to run the MongodDB service. Generally you will want it open in a separate tab, running in the background.
  > mongod
Note: If you already have an instance of MongoDB running, you'll get an error at this step. If that's the case, you can move on to the next step, since MongoDB is already running!

Running your MongoDB service is a lot like running your Express Server!

- Embeded vs reference:
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/mongoose-associations#association-categories-for-mongoose
Embeded: it performace faster since it doesn't have to look up each time (obj is nested)
Reference: It has another table of its id.
  - reference it is easy to update the data info

  - DATA integrity: servers being separated when one place noSQL 

- Check for Understanding
How would you design the following? Draw an ERD for each set of related data? Can you draw an ERD for each?

* Users with many Tweets? embeded
  one user only one user needs to get access to the data > embedded it.
  one *user to many * twitt

## The Holy Grail Layout 

![holy grail layout](img/holy-grail-layout.png)

This is something you know well, even if you don't recognize the term. It describes a webpage with a header bar, a footer bar, and three columns along the middle: a wide "main" column, a navigation column on the left, and an advertisement, site map, or extra info column along the right.

Obviously, this layout won't work on tiny screens, unless you really like super-skinny columns. It's common to stack things on top of each other for mobile views to make one single column.

Before flexbox, this involved a lot of pushing and shoving with dimensions and positioning. You would essentially have to write two completely separate stylesheets: one for mobile, and one for desktop.

With flexbox, just change the `flex-direction` for smaller screen sizes, make any size / order adjustments on the sections of the page, and you're pretty much done!

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 600px){
  main {
    flex-direction: column;
  }

  section {
    order: 1;
  }
}
```

> A layout so holy, [it has its own Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail_(web_design)).

# Flexbox

## Learning Objectives

- Give an example of a problem solved by Flexbox.
- Contrast flex containers and flex items.
- Given a desktop-first webpage, make it look presentable on mobile devices (and vice-versa) with as little CSS as possible.
- Explain what is meant by the "Holy Grail Layout".

## Framing 

HTML was created as a document-oriented language. CSS emerged as a way to use language to precisely define stylistic features in a way that wouldn't clutter the semantic content or worse destroy the semantic value all together. CSS pursued the related goal of normalizing styling across browsers. In many ways it achieves this goal well; yet it remains one of the most frustrating parts of web development.

![Obligatory Peter Griffin CSS GIF](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-41v6n3Vaf5s/UeRN_XJ0keI/AAAAAAAAN2Y/YxIHhddGiaw/s1600/css.gif)

It's difficult to establish new CSS standards. The [CSS Working Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Working_Group) works to further the language of CSS, but with competing views of the members and the problem of cross-browser consistency, this can take considerable time.  

Alignment has traditionally been one of the key contributors to this aggravation. In the last decade, the importance of alignment has sky rocketed.

> Why might this be?

Today we'll be learning about one modern CSS tool to help with making an easier-to-write and more versatile website layout.

Flexbox, a layout mode introduced with CSS3, is at this point widely implemented across different browsers. CSS Grid, an even newer layout mode which borrows from the best parts of CSS bootstrap, is also becoming popular.  It is not as widely implemented as Flexbox but it does work on most modern browsers.  

> We can check https://caniuse.com/ to see what browsers support what we want to implement.  

## Problem 1: Vertical Alignment 

Let's start out by talking about a problem that anybody who has written CSS has likely dealt with:

**I have a `div`. I would like to center it vertically and horizontally on my page.** The end result should look something like this...

![centered div](img/centered_div.png)

Example on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/awhitley1233/pen/ygJzJW)

### You Do: 
Take about **10 minutes** to try to get the div in this example centered like the image above. Make sure it's still centered vertically and horizontally when you change the screen size.

#### You Tell Me: What Should I Try?

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div> Div 1 </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

```CSS
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background: #990012;
  color: #FFFFFF;
  border-radius: 10px;
  font: 14pt Comic Sans MS;
  text-align: center;
  line-height: 100px;
}
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>These might work...</strong></summary>

  > **Padding**: The simplest approach would be to set equal padding on the top and bottom of the container (body) element. We would need to know the exact height of the element and container in order to get this exactly right. This can also get tedious when there is more than one element in a container.
  >
  > **Margin**: Similarly, we could add some margin to the element we are trying to center. The same issues remain.
  >
  > **Absolute Positioning**: You could use properties like `top` and `left` to position an element in the center. This, however, removes it from the document flow.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>These could work in other scenarios...</strong></summary>

  > **`line-height`**: When vertically centering a single line of text, you can set the line-height to that of the whole container.
  >
  > **`vertical-align`**: Used to align words within a line of text (e.g., superscript, subscript).

</details>

The tough part is that how to vertically center a element depends on its context meaning that an element has to look to its parent and then align itself; siblings start to make this very difficult. Depending on your situation, one or more of the above techniques could work. [Here's an enlightening post on the matter](https://css-tricks.com/centering-in-the-unknown/).

### Flexbox to the Rescue

```CSS
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  margin: 0 auto;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

View solution [here](http://codepen.io/awhitley1233/pen/EZyvMY)

## How It Works 

![flexbox diagram](img/flexbox-diagram.jpg)

When you declare `display: flex;` in a CSS rule, whatever is targeted by that rule becomes a **flex container**.

The flexbox approach differs from the methods described in the CodePen above in that the arrangement of elements is managed by the **parent** container. The child of a **flex container** is called a **flex item**. We can change the way flex items display by setting item-specific properties that will come later in the lesson.

After the `display` property, the most important flexbox property to understand is `flex-direction`. It is very important to remember that the `flex-direction` orients **flex container's main-axis**. The main axis can set to run vertically or horizontally depending on the value of `flex-direction`. All other flex-related properties are defined in terms of the main axis.

First, use `flex-direction` to indicate whether you want the flex items in the container to "read" left-to-right (`row`), right-to-left (`row-reverse`), top-to-bottom (`column`), **or** bottom-to-top (`column-reverse`).

| flex-direction | main-axis start |
|----------------|-----------------|
| row (default)  | left            |
| column         | top             |
| row-reverse    | right           |
| column-reverse | bottom          |

The `justify-content` property aligns content relative to the **main axis**. Possible values are: `flex-start` (default), `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, and `space-around`.

> What do you think each does; does the flex-direction affect this?

The `align-items` property is similar to `justify-content` but aligns relative to the **cross-axis**. There are similar options here: `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `stretch` (default), and `baseline` (items are aligned by their baselines / where the text is).

By default, a **flex container** will arrange its children in a single row or column. The `flex-wrap` property can modify this with the values `nowrap` (default), `wrap`, and `wrap-reverse`.

When text is wrapping, `align-content` controls how the rows or columns are arranged relative to the cross-axis: `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `stretch` (default), `center`, `space-between`, and `space-around`.

### In Summary...

| Property | What's It Do? | Examples |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **display**  |               | `flex`   |
| **[flex-direction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction)** | Sets the directional flow of flex items | `row`, `column` |
| **[justify-content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content)** | Align along main axis | `center`, `space-between` |
| **[align-items](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items)** | Align along cross-axis | `flex-start`, `center` |

> That's a lot of CSS properties! Don't worry, you're not expected to memorize all of them. Being a developer is less about knowing everything off the top of your head and more about knowing best practices and where to find more info [Here's a great resource](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).

## Problem 2: Make the Footer Stick 

I want my footer to lie along the bottom of my page. Once I've accomplished that, I want to evenly distribute the content boxes horizontally inside of the `<main>` element.

![flexbox layout](img/flex-box-example2.png)

[Example on CodePen](http://codepen.io/awhitley1233/pen/ygJzqy)

#### You Tell Me: What Should I Try?

```html
<html>
  <header>
    FlexBox
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>Content 1</section>
    <section>Content 2</section>
    <section>Content 3</section>
  </main>
  <footer>
    CodePen by Andrew Whitley
  </footer>
</html>
```

```CSS
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  margin: 0 auto;
  font: 12pt Comic Sans MS;
}

header, footer {
  width: 100%;
  height: 30px;
  background: #000000;
  color: #FFFFFF;
  text-align: center;
  line-height: 30px;
}

main {
  background: #D3D3D3;
}

section {
  width: 100px;
  background: #990012;
  color: #FFFFFF;
  border-radius: 10px;
  margin: 5px;
  text-align: center;
  line-height: 100px;
}
```

Making the footer lie against the bottom of the screen is pretty easy: just use absolute or fixed positioning. However, using absolute or fixed positioning means everything else on the page ignores my footer. The text of `<main>` could easily run under the footer. We want the text to "push" the footer to the end of the page.

### Flexbox to the Rescue

```CSS
body {
  min-height: 100vh;
  margin: 0 auto;
  font: 12pt Comic Sans MS;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>How is main axis of the `body` oriented here? What about the cross-axis?</strong></summary>

  > Main: vertically, Cross: horizontally

</details>


Now let's horizontally distribute the `<section>` elements containing the page's content inside of the `<main>`. What element should we style?

```CSS
main {
  background: #D3D3D3;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
}
```

## You Do: More Flexbox Properties 

Time for you to research some more Flexbox properties. You will be split into groups and assigned one of the following flex properties...

- `flex-wrap`
- `flex-grow`
- `order`
- `align-content`

Your task is to...
* Come up with [ELI5 ("Explain Like I'm 5")](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive) definition for the property.
* List the different values this property can take.
* Create [a Codepen](http://codepen.io) demonstrating the property's usage, then post it in the `#wdi-sf51-strictlybiz` Slack channel.
* If possible, practice using some of the flex properties we covered in the previous section.

> You will need to [create a Codepen account](https://codepen.io/accounts/signup) in order to save your pen and share the link.

If you finish early, try exploring some of the [other flexbox properties](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) not assigned in this exercise.

REACT is frontEND library
- https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/react-intro
FramEND: opinionated, decide everything for you
library you can do certain way, Standardize code, functionality
What case should you pick framework vs library?
  - big company prefer framework: prduct looks same standardize code. knowing a universal language
  - attrition rate high: people leave, it has no learning curve.  Transition is smooth
  - startups: even with high attrition rate. startup need flexibility, framework takes time and memory
      library: don't need time, memory, tech company find library 
        it is easy to start and go. React library.

  - Learning 3rd party library Django (Python framework)
  - major: react has re-rendering
  - react follows MVC: model view controller, 
    - `client` (my web browser) >>> (sends request)>>>> `Controaller` >>>> Model 
                                                                     (VIEWS)

      server logic lies on controller, model talks to your db.
      React lies on views, controllers, models
      mvc: separate of 3 components, so that there is less coupling
          High cohesion. they are independent of eachother,
          if you want to change one component (view) > you do'nt have to update other components
          vs. mongodb (all are related and you have to update all of them)
      - mvc architecture I use

    - components are fundamental building blocks of our app (react)
- components are small chunks of (standard: template, another page> )
  How to id the component on the page? any function that is getting reused
  component structure as tree (parent > child)

- treelike structure: as a developer needs to decide what structure look like
  component: we have to know what your app has to look like.
  - https://www.maketea.co.uk/2014/03/05/building-robust-web-apps-with-react-part-1.html

- react : low coupling (component: independent of each other)
          high cohesion (related code needs to put together, they performance)
          - https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/react-intro#focused
          https://addyosmani.com/first/
  - react routing, library can be added therefore it is not framework.

- before you start draw out your app structure

What happens how HTML shows on browser?
  1) DOM 
    2) DOM tree gets created (Using HTML parser)
      3) Attachment: << CSS styling on that
        4) re-render tree with CSS styling on it
          5) painting: 
            6) finally Display of the page

React is single direction dataflow- parent -> kids
  - we need to think of component tree (props are immutable) we can't change
  https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/react-state-and-props#components

  component: fosced, independent, reuable, small, testable
  - when something justify new componenet?  what is the decision factor?
index page > containing header component, archive component 
    this is what we are doing making more focused.  tricky for reuasble ex) archive we only use once
    - we can reuse those component and create a blog 
      pick out 

  - small: if you have 500 line component: refactor trim down

### Props: component: representation data ui 
Props: data pass down

import react, react-doem
component we are workign with 

// index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import Hello from './App.js'

// props react passed in ame={"Nick"} in curly!
ReactDOM.render(
  // Hello component
  <Hello name={"Nick"} age={24} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
)

************
// App.js
class Hello extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
      // hello brock here
        <h1>Hello {this.props.name}</h1>
        <p>You are {this.props.age} years old</p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}


// hello components with diff data passing in
<Hello name={"Nick"} age={24} />
<Hello name={"Billy"} age={30} />
<Hello name={"Sheryl"} age={24} />
<Hello name={"Spencer"} age={15} />

- State: The limitation of props is that we can't change the data from within the component. 
The data that we can change within a component is called state. We can't change the props
so we can change State:

- react (event driven purpose in mind)
  event driven things, user is doing something, 
  ex) user update statue, 
    front, backend reflects
    react event driven flow is done by state

- aspect of state: when state change component re-render
  when data changes - take in user's input > state obj >
  this is due to props can't be changed

What do we use props for?  
What do we use state for? for all comments component get that equal
Props: pushes data down, props exists as as property state exists as component definsiton itself
  - props are key name awhen defining key name.
  - props transfering data around, state: things are updated re-rendered
  - props data down the tree of components.

# Event Handlers and the Component Lifecycle in React

## Learning Objectives
* Understand how to use React's lifecycle methods
* Retrieve data from an API inside of a component
* Handle events in React
* Look at the React documentation to learn more

## Framing (10 min / 0:10)

So far, we've used react components to build simple applications. We've added state and props and controlled data flow through them (using just the render and setState methods). In order to do more complex things, we'll have to use lifecycle methods.

How do we get data from an API? Well we could drop in an AJAX call to fetch some data, but our component would likely render before the AJAX request finished. Our component would see that our data is `undefined` and either render a blank/empty component or throw an error.

How would we animate a component? (i.e. a sidebar that usually lives off the page, except for when a hamburger menu is pressed.) We could write some code to animate the position of the sidebar, but how could we guarantee it was running after our Sidebar component's render method had been called?

This lesson will walk us through the Component Lifecycle: hooks that are fired at different stages of a components "life" for solving the problems described above, as well as many others.

Throughout the course of this lesson, we'll build out a simple flashcard app with vocabulary keywords pulled from the Oxford Dictionary API. Our flashcard app will cycle through a set of flashcards, giving us 10 seconds to think of the definition before moving on to the next card.

But first, what is the Component Lifecycle?

## The Component Lifecycle (10 min / 0:20)

Components provide several lifecycle methods that you can use to control your application based on the state of the UI.

When you include these methods in the component they will be invoked automatically (because we are extending the React.Component class which has them already defined).

Lifecycle methods are called at specific points in the rendering process. You can use these methods to perform actions based on what's happening on the DOM.

* `componentWillUnmount` is called immediately *before* a component is removed from the DOM.
* `componentDidMount`, for example, is called immediately *after* a component is rendered to the DOM.

**What do you use lifecycle methods for?**

Making asynchronous requests (ajax calls), binding event listeners to components, animating components (once they've rendered), and optimizing for performance (shouldComponentUpdate).

**Why is it called a lifecycle?**
It's an action that repeats in a specific order.

![ ](./images/react_lifecycle_methods.png  "React-component-lifecycle")

### At a very high level

There are two types of component lifecycle methods:

* **Mounting** lifecycle methods. e.g. What happens when the component is created? Was an initial state set? Methods:
  - `constructor(props)`
  - `UNSAFE_componentWillMount()`
  - `static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`
  - `render()`
  - `componentDidMount()`

* **Updating** lifecycle methods. e.g. Has state changed? Methods:
  - `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps()`
  - `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`
  - `UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate()`
  - `render()`
  - `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`
  - `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)`
 
* **Unmounting** lifecycle method when the component is removed from DOM
  - `componentWillUnmount()`
	
The documentation gives good examples of what each method should be used for. [Check out the documentation on components!](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html)

## We do: Exploring the Lifecycle methods (20 min / 0:40)

Let's clone down [this repository](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-WDI/react-component-lifecycle/tree/master/react-component-lifecycle) with a short exercise for exploring the lifecycle methods.

This exercise is a simple, 2 "page" website where each page is a component. We'll be adding the component lifecycle methods to each page-component. As we do consider the following questions:

* What order are the methods run in? Before or after rendering?
* How many times is the method invoked?
* What causes the method to be (re)invoked?

> Add the mounting methods to HomePage.js and the update methods to AboutPage.js. console.log something in each method to understand the order.

### An Aside: Axios (10 min / 0:50)

For our first example of working with the component lifecycle methods, we'll be retrieving data from an API using AJAX.
AJAX calls are asynchronous, so we have to be mindful of how long our request will take and when our components will render.

We're going to use a module named `axios` to make our calls. Axios is a node module commonly used with React to send HTTP requests to an API. It functions much like jQuery's Ajax method, or window.Fetch(). Some benefits to using Axios:

> npm install axios --save

* It is a promise-based library with an interface for simpler and cleaner syntax (compared to native XHR especially).
* It is lightweight and focused solely on handling HTTP requests (as opposed to jQuery which brings in an extensive set of new functions and methods)
* It is very configurable and has a number of useful methods for doing more complex requests from one or multiple API endpoints
* It handles a lot of the http header manual work for you (e.g. send a json file, it sets `Content-Type: application/json`)

Read more at the [Axios Documentation](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios)

> Note: Axios is just one of many Javascript libraries that we could use for handling requests. One of the big selling points of javascript is the ability to mix and match technologies according to preference. Other commonly-used tools for handling requests are fetch and jQuery.

To load in the Axios module:
> npm install axios --save
https://github.com/axios/axios


```js
// If you are using Babel to compile your code
import axios from 'axios'

// In standard vanilla Javascript
let axios = require('axios')
```

To use Axios to query an API at a given url endpoint:

```js
axios.get('url')
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response)
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error)
  })
```

<!-- You can also append values to the parameters by passing in a second input to `.get()`:

```js
  axios.get('url', {
    params: {
      key1: value1,
      key2: value2
    }
  })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response)
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error)
  })
```

Which would result in a GET request to: `url?key1=value1&key2=value2`.

<!-- ### We Do: Axios and AJAX inside a React Component:
> 15 min / 1:05

We will be using Axios to query the PokéAPI in [this exercise](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-exercises/react-components-axios). -->

## Flashcards (90 min / 2:30)

As we dive deeper in to each of the component lifecycle methods and what they're used for, we'll work through the following exercise to create a simple flashcards app.

The starter code for this exercise can be found [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-WDI/flashcards).

Let's go ahead and clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-WDI/flashcards
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The app we're going to build will pull characters from a dictionary API and create a flashcard for each word and definition`. The app will then cycle through each word, giving the user 10 seconds to think of the definition before moving on to the next card. 

The solution code is [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-WDI/flashcards/tree/solution)

### We Do: Adding the Flashcard Container

#### Use Axios to query the dictionary API

<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>

```js
// FlashcardContainer.js

class FlashcardContainer extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super(); 

    this.state = {
      flashcards: [],
      currentIndex: 0
    }
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    axios.get(CLIENT_URL)
      .then((response) => {
          console.log(response)
          this.setState({flashcards: response.data})
        })
  }

  render() {
    let detail = this.state.flashcards[this.state.currentIndex]
    let card;

    if(detail) {
      card = <Flashcard detail={detail}/>
    }

    return (
      <div>
        {card}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

</details>

The componentDidMount method is called once, immediately after your component is rendered to the DOM. If you want to make an AJAX request when your component first renders, this is where to do it (not in the constructor, or in componentWillMount). componentWillMount shouldn't be used for server requests because it may be invoked multiple times before render. Side effects should be avoided in the constructor, and so server requests shouldn't be made there.

#### Add an event listener to switch between cards

<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>

```js
//FlashcardContainer.js

class FlashcardContainer extends Component {
  state = {
      flashcards: [],
      currentIndex: 0
    }

  // increment currentIndex
  next () {
    let nextIndex = (this.state.currentIndex + 1) === this.state.flashcards.length
      ? this.state.currentIndex
      : this.state.currentIndex + 1

    this.setState({currentIndex: nextIndex})
  }

  // decremement currentIndex
  prev () {
    let prevIndex = (this.state.currentIndex - 1) < 0
      ? 0
      : (this.state.currentIndex - 1)

    this.setState({currentIndex: prevIndex})
  }

  // callback to be used in the event listener below
  handleKeyUp (event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 39) this.next()
    if (event.keyCode === 37) this.prev()
  }

  componentDidMount () {
    window.addEventListener('keyup', this.handleKeyUp)

    axios
      .get(CLIENT_URL)
      .then(response => this.setState({flashcards: response.data}))
      .catch(err => console.log(err))
  }

  render() {
    let detail = this.state.flashcards[this.state.currentIndex]
    let card;

    if(detail) {
      card = <Flashcard detail={detail}/>
    }

    return (
      <div>
        {card}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

</details>

In this example, we have added a constructor that has a few initial state properties. We also add an event listener that switches to the next card on right arrow press. Finally, we add an API pull to fetch the dynamic data we will use for the app.

### You Do: Adding a Timer to the Flashcard

Add a timer to the Flashcard Detail component.

* Initialize the timer to have 10 seconds on it
* Every second the same flashcard is still on the board, remove a second from it
> **hint**: use `setInterval()`)
* When the timer reaches zero, switch to the next card
> **hint**: where did you define the `next()` method? How can you access it from `Flashcard.js`?
* When the `Flashcard` component receives a new card, restart the timer


#### We Do: Adding the Definition Component

Now that we have our flashcard displayed, lets add their definitions as well.

For this, we will use a pure functional component -- or a component created by a function instead of a class -- and then change its style dynamically based on its index.

<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>

```js
//Definition.js

import React from 'react';

let Definition = (props) => {

	return (
		<div className="">
			<p>{props.def}</p>
		</div>
	)
}

export default Definition;
```

```js
// Flashcard.js
...
class Flashcard extends Component {
  render() {
    let defs = this.props.detail.definitions[0].definitions 

    return (
      <div class="card">
        <p>{this.props.detail.word}</p>
        { defs.map(def => <Definition def={def} /> )}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
...
```

</details>

## You Do: Show or Hide the Definition

Add a button that, when clicked, toggles whether or not the definition card is displayed on the page.

## React Documentation

* What is an uncontrolled component in React? Why would we use it instead of a controlled one?
* Describe 1-way and 2-way data binding. Which model does React use? Explain and compare to other popular front-end frameworks.
* Describe how to best gather information from a form in React. Be prepared to show code!
* Compare and contrast stateful, stateless, and functional components in React. List the pros and cons of each. When would we use one over the other?

## Bonus



## Event Handlers

Throughout the last few classes, you've seen a couple event handlers. These look similar to including them inline in HTML.

In the React Intro class, we went over how we are not actually interacting directly with the DOM when we write React code, rather, we are interacting with the virtualDOM. Because of this, when we call an event listener, we use `SyntheticEvent`'s instead of the usual event objects we are used to dealing with in JQuery events. We still get all of the same properties attached to them, and some additional ones. Because of this, the traditional documentation on event handlers is sometimes not accurate. Instead, use the React event handling documentation found [here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html). Spend a few minutes looking at the different events on listed here.

# React Counters

By building this simple application, we'll explore the concepts of state, the differences between props and state and how we can change state from within a component using events.

To get started:

```sh
git clone git@git.generalassemb.ly:ga-wdi-exercises/react-counters.git
cd react-counters
npm install

```
### How to start react app from internet download:
```sh
1) > npm install  // install all npm package in package.json
2) > npm i -g create-react-app // NPM package also built by Facebook that writes our build dependencies for us so that we can do less configuration. It allows us to use React, JSX, and ES6. It also allows us to import our CSS, it autoprefixes our CSS so that we don't have to worry about cross browser compatibility, it gives us a dev server to run, and it enables hot reloading which updates the code in our browser without us refreshing the page.

Webpack which is a build tool that enables many of the features listed above. It also includes Babel which transpiles our JavaScript from ES6 to be compatible with older browsers. It also includes Autoprefixer for CSS compatibility, ESLint for linting, and Jest for testing.

3) > npm start  // refers to the included script that starts up the developmemt server

After running $ `npm start`, we can view the app at `http://localhost:3000`
Most important files are uner: `/src` directory.
Note: `./src/App.js`, `./src/index.js`

      </div>
    )
  }
}


First we can pass multiple properties to our component when its rendered in src/index.js..

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import Hello from './App.js'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Hello name={"Nick"} age={24} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
Then in our component definition we have access to both values…

# State and Data-flow

## Learning Objectives

* Review passing data to a React component via `props`.
* Define and use nested components.
* Identify `state` in a React app.
* Modify the `state` of a React component through events.
* Distinguish container and presentational components.

## Framing

In this lesson we will be looking at how data is managed within a React application. In particular, we will compare and contrast a component's `props` and `state`. They are similar, but have a couple key distinctions:

* `props` are passed into a component, but `state` is local or native to the component
* While we cannot change `props` (immutable) from within a component, we can change a component's `state` (mutable).

First, let's revisit the fundamental unit of any React app: **components**.

## Components

Think back to F.I.R.S.T. principles of components. Components are:

* **Focused**,
* **Independent**,
* **Reusable**,
* **Small**, and
* **Testable**.

We design components to do as little as possible (*small*, *focused*) with a minimal amount of dependence on other components (*independence*, *reusable*).

## Props

While components should be independent, we still need them to talk to each other by passing data. However, to keep components small and focused, we pass only the data that is *specific to that component's purpose*. Data that is passed into one component by a parent component (or the application root), we refer to as `props`.

Let's take another look at our `Hello` component.

```jsx
// index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import Hello from './App.js'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Hello name={"Nick"} age={24} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

```jsx
// App.js
class Hello extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello {this.props.name}</h1>
        <p>You are {this.props.age} years old</p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Props are one of the things that make React so powerful and help us make **independent** and **reusable** components. We can pass different data to our `Hello` component and easily get the same html and css but with different data:

```jsx
<Hello name={"Nick"} age={24} />
<Hello name={"Billy"} age={30} />
<Hello name={"Sheryl"} age={24} />
<Hello name={"Spencer"} age={15} />
```

Here we are passing values, `"Nick"` and `24` into our first `Hello` component in `index.js`, where we are **composing** `Hello` with the JSX expression, `<Hello name={"Nick"} age={24} />`. The `name` prop and `age` prop hold the values `"Nick"` and `24`, respectively. We cannot change the values of received `props` in a component - they are **immutable**. So what do we do with data we want to control from within a component?

## State

The limitation of props is that we can't change the data from within the component. The data that we can change within a component is called **[state](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)**. We haven't talked about state much, but you have worked with it before. Just think about if you were to develop a game. Here are some examples:

* **Trivia**: what is the current score, what card is currently displayed to the user, is the user's input correct or incorrect?
* **Simon**: what order of buttons did the user push, what is the order of buttons they were supposed to push, what round or level are they on?
* **Tower of Hanoi**: how many discs are in each tower, how many moves has the user made?

We can figure out the `state` of a turn-based game because there is a clear idea of a beginning and end and states that reflect progress from one turn to the next turn: what flash card is the user on, what buttons do they need to push, how are the discs distributed among the three towers.


*Q: So we know an application can have different states. But how do we transition in between them?*

Events! (or user actions)


### F.I.R.S.T. Principles and State

The aim of the F.I.R.S.T. principles is to create a sane approach to breaking down not just a user-interface, but also an application's data so it is easy-to-manage chunks of data and the components that render them.

*Each component is concerned only with the data relevant to its purpose*.

For your first project, you had to do that manually. Manually write event listeners that would update state stored in global scope and then update your UI by manually updating individual DOM nodes.

You can think of React as an event-driven state machine, or a machine that churns out new states as a result of user interactions. A React application receives input through user interactions (event listeners) and outputs a UI that reflects a brand new state (new cards, fewer or more chips, etc).


 *Q: What do we mean by a React component's "state"?*

The object properties of a component (`this.state`) that change as the application runs, as opposed to `this.props`, which are immutable.


### State and Rendering

Before moving on to build our application, it's worth mentioning another aspect of component `state`: when it changes our components re-render:

![react component image](./images/react-component-state-update.png)

Our UI gets updated when state changes. The user takes some action, like submitting information via a form, and the component holding that form has a `state` that is updated with the value of the user's input.

## Let's build something together.

Together we are going to grow our blog application with state and props! Yay!

```bash
git clone git@git.generalassemb.ly:sf-wdi-51/react-state-and-props.git
cd react-state-and-props/blog-app
npm install
npm start
```
You should be greeted with a Hello message. 

Now let's install a handy tool. [React Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)

At the moment we will see our greeting component inside of google chrome's development tools under the React tab. (We can even see our props/state!)

Now let's create a new folder components and create 2 new components (Post and Comment) inside that folder.

Your structure should look like this:

```
blog-app
├──  favicon.ico
├──  public
├──  node_modules
├──  package.json
└──  src
    ├──  components
          └──  Comment.js
          └──  Post.js
    ├──  App.css
    ├──  App.js
    ├──  index.css
    ├──  index.js
    └──  logo.svg

```

Let's throw some info into those files! 

**Post.js**
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
// Load in Comment component
import Comment from './Comment.js'

class Post extends Component {
    render() {
      let comments = this.props.comments.map((comment, index) => (
        <Comment message={comment} key={index}/>
      ))
      return(
        <div className='post-page'>
          <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
          <h2>By {this.props.author}</h2>
          <p>{this.props.body}</p>
          <h3>Comments</h3>
          {comments}
        </div>
      )
    }
  }

export default Post;
```

Let's break down the above code. We created a Post component that takes in the props: title, author, body, and an array of comments. For each comment inside of *this.props.comments* it will create a Comment component. Since this file requires the Comment component let's update that next. 

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react'

class Comment extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{this.props.message}</p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default Comment
```
Awesome! Now to update our index.js to render out the Post Component.

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import Post from './components/Post'
import './App.css'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Post className='post' title={'A Day in the Life of React Development.'} author={'Disgruntled Dev'} body={'COMPONENTS EVERYWHERE!! AHHHHH!!'} comments={['Some shaddy internet comment.','A rare comment with actual feedback.']}/>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

As you can see we are rendering a Post component with the props that we defined earlier.

You should see this now: 

![example react one](./images/blog-app1.png)

So far we have dealt with only props to pass information from one component to another. But, what if we wanted data to change within a component? Time for State! 

As an example we will be adding "Karma" to our comments. (This will make sense in a moment I promise.)

Let's set state inside of our comments. 

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react'

class Comment extends Component {
  state = {
    karma: 'good'
  };

  render () {
    return (
      <div className={this.state.karma}>
        <p>{this.props.message}</p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default Comment
```
Inside our dev tools we will now see that by default we have set the state of karma to 'good' for all comments. We also used this state to declare a classname attached to our comment component. Now that we have a set state we can now create a method built into our component to update the state.

We will be creating a ChangeKarma method to update our state and a button that will call the method. Simply the function checks the state and toggles it depending on what it is.

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react'

class Comment extends Component {
  state = {
    karma: 'good'
  };

  changeKarma(){
    if (this.state.karma === 'good'){
      this.setState({
        karma: 'bad'
      })
    } else {
      this.setState({
        karma: 'good'
      })
    }
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <div className={this.state.karma}>
        <p>{this.props.message}</p>
        <button className={"button"} onClick={this.changeKarma}>Change Karma</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default Comment
```

So onClick the button will run the method changeKarma. BUT WAIT! It errors! Because of the fact that this method is created inside of a constructor we have to bind it to the component so *this* keyword will work correctly. 

```js
  state = {
    karma: 'good'
  };
  changeKarma = this.changeKarma.bind(this);
```
Amazing!  Now when we click on our button the class attached to the component is switched without having to refresh the page. 

**What other type of states can we add?**

## Check for Understanding

* What is the difference between `state` and `props`?
* What do we use `props` for?
* What do we use `state` for?

We've done a fair amount of framing so far, so let's dive in to building another application!

## Exercise: React Counters

For this exercise, we are going to build a React app from scratch that will serve as an [Abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus) of sorts.

Go ahead and clone [React Counters](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-exercises/react-counters) now. This will be the code we start with.

```bash
$ git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-exercises/react-counters
$ cd react-counters
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Start with a Mock

The first step in creating a React app is to start with a [mock](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html#start-with-a-mock) and some sample data.

### You Do: Identify Components 


Look at this [deployed version of the application](http://react-counter.surge.sh/) and answer the following questions:

- How many components does this application have?
- What components is this application built of?

### Components

<details>
  <summary><strong>Open to see the components</strong></summary>

  ![](./images/react-counter-annotated.png)

Here we've identified four components on the home page:
  1. The top level component, which we'll call `App`, is boxed in red
  2. The header component, a sub-component of `App`, is boxed in purple. We'll call it `Header`
  3. The list of counters, also a sub-component of `App`, is boxed in blue. We'll called it `ContainerList`
  4. An individual container, a sub-component of `ContainerList`, is boxed in green. We'll call it `Counter`

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Open to see component hierarchy</strong></summary>

  <h4>Component Hierarchy</h4>

Given these breakdowns we have a component hierarchy that looks like this:

  - `App`
    - `Header`
    - `CounterList`
      - `Counter`

</details>

### Sample Data

In the final application, we'll be able to use the two buttons in the header to increase and decrease the number of individual counters on the page. However, to start, we're going to feed the number of counters into the application as hard-coded data.

The below Javascript will go in our `index.js` file and will later be passed into our `App` component as props:

```js
const data = {
  counters: 5
}
```

## Building a Static Version of the App


First we will [build a static version](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html#step-2-build-a-static-version-in-react) of the app passing all of our data by `props`. This makes it much easier to avoid getting bogged down in tricky details of functionality while implementing the visual appearance of the UI.

### You Do: Set Up the `App` Component and `index.js`


Try to get it so that your `App` component displays the number of counters underneath the `Header` component (provided in the starter code).

<details>
	<summary>Solution</summary>
	
`index.js`:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";

const data = {
  counters: 5
};

ReactDOM.render(<App data={data} />, document.getElementById("root"));
```
	
`App.js`:

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import Header from "./Header";

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <Header />
        <h4>{this.props.data.counters}</h4>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```
</details>

### You Do: Set Up the `CounterList` and `Counter` Components


Your `CounterList` component should take the number of counters as a prop and then render that many versions of your `Counter` component. Your `Counter` component will render `"Counter: 0"` inside of an `<h4>` and two buttons (one for incrementing and one for decrementing).

**Tip:** You can render an array of components! It looks something like this:

```js

## Identify the Minimal Representation of UI State 

At the moment all of our data is being passed through our app as props. We know, however, that we will have data that changes as a user interacts with the app. That information needs to live in our application's state. We need to figure out what the [minimal amount of state](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html#step-3-identify-the-minimal-but-complete-representation-of-ui-state) our app needs and what components need it.

### You Do: What information needs to live in state? 

This may include a value(s) that we have not yet included in our code.

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

For our app to work we need:

- `numberOfCounters` (the number of counters to render in our `App` component)
- `count` (the count of a `Counter` component)
</details>

## Identify Where Your State Should Live 

Central to [deciding where state lives](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html#step-4-identify-where-your-state-should-live) is the idea of **one way data flow**. The React documentation describes this step as "often the most challenging part for newcomers to understand" since we are learning to distinguish state from props.   

Our task here is to find the proper place for each part of our application's state.

## Working with State 

Lets start with our `Counter` component. Right now, it doesn't have any state and it isn't passed any props. What we want is for the `Counter` component to keep track of the count in state. Then, whenever someone clicks one of the two buttons we'll increase or decrease that number.

### We Do: Update our `Counter` Component

Lets update the `Counter` component so that it is using state to track the count internally and clicking one of the buttons changes the `count` number.

<details>
	<summary>Solution</summary>
	
```diff
import React, { Component } from "react";

class Counter extends Component {
+    state = {
+      count: 0
+    };	

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="Counter">
        <h4>Counter: {this.state.count}</h4>
-        <button>Decrement</button>
+        <button onClick={this.increaseCount}>Decrement</button>
-        <button>Increment</button>
+        <button onClick={this.decreaseCount}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }

+  increaseCount = () => {
+    let count = this.state.count + 1;
+
+    this.setState({
+      count
+    });
+  }
+
+  decreaseCount = () => {
+    let count = this.state.count - 1;
+
+    this.setState({
+      count
+    });
  }
}

export default Counter;
```
</details>

Now that we've made it so our `Counter` component is tracking it's count inside of state, we need to update our application so that the prop determining the number of counters is controlled by state.

This segues nicely into the idea of Container and Presentational Components.

## Container & Presentational Components 

The above workflow has led to the popular component architecture of distinguishing [Container and Presentational Components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0).

**Presentational components** are components that render themselves based solely on the information that they receive from props. At this point, all of our components are presentational.

**Container components** are components whose job it is to exclusively manage state and and render presentational components, passing them the data they need as props.

This leads to a very nice division where state management and presentation are cleanly separated.

Our `App` component could be a **container component!**

### You Do: Update `App`


We want to update `App` so that it is tracking the number of counters to render in it's `state`. To do that, we need to update our component.

Make it so that the `App` component is tracking the number of counters (5) inside state and passing that as a prop to the `CounterList` component.

<details>
	<summary>Solution</summary>
	
```diff
// App.js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import Header from "./Header";
import CounterList from "./CounterList";

class App extends Component {
+  constructor() {
+    super();
+
+    this.state = {
+      counters: 5
+    };
+  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <Header />
-        <CounterList counter={this.props.data.counters} />
+        <CounterList counter={this.state.counters} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```
</details>

Our `CounterList` component is now rendering the number of counters in the state of our `App` component, but we don't have a way to update our state!

Just like in your first project, we're going to update the state of our application in response to events. In this particular case, we'll update state (the number of counters to render) when someone clicks one of the two buttons in the header.

There's just one issue: those two buttons are in our `Header` component (a presentational component).

## Add Inverse Data Flow 

We can give presentational components behavior by passing callback functions to them as props. By binding those callback functions to the parent, container component we can use them to update our state. In React, we refer to this as [inverse data flow](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html#step-5-add-inverse-data-flow). We will need two functions defined in `App` and passed to `Header`.

### You Do: Increase and Decrease the Number of Counters

Define an `increaseCounters()` method and `decreaseCounters()` method on the `App` component (they'll be a lot like the `increaseCount()` and decreaseCount()` methods of our `Counter` component).

Once your two methods are defined, pass them both to the `Header` component as props. What do you need to do inside of `Header` to make it so that when someone clicks on one of the buttons the number of counters increases or decreases?

## Closing 

If asked, could you explain the differences between props and state? We've now covered the differences between the two as well as how you can use state to control data inside a component and how to update state to display new data to a user.

Defining components and working with props and state (data) constitutes the majority of the work of building a React application.

## Bonus

### Style in React

When it comes to adding styles to React, there is a bit of debate over what's the best practice. Facebook's official docs and recommendations are to write stylesheets that treat your CSS rule declarations as properties on one big Javascript object that can be passed into components via inline styles.

From the [Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html)...

>  "In React, inline styles are not specified as a string. Instead they are specified with an object whose key is the camelCased version of the style name, and whose value is the style's value, usually a string"

However, this kind of rethinking the wheel feels like a step backwards for a lot of designers and developers who cringe at the notion of inline styles. For them, they choose to build React apps through a more traditional flow of adding ids and classes and then targeting elements via external stylesheets.

Also, via Webpack and other custom loaders, it is possible to use many third-party libraries or processors such as SASS, LESS, and Post-CSS.

Interesting to note, this problem has not been universally solved, and thus the debate will most likely continue to rage on until somebody figures it out. Therefore, its often left to a team decision when choosing the best option for the application.

### [Example of Object Literal Styles with React](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/react-omdb/commit/830697fc68dcdccafcae9f73e711103de8d93fc9)

> **Reminder**: `class` is a protected keyword in React, in order to add a class attribute to an element use the keyword `className`

To add the finishing touches to our application, let's take a stab at styling our app with inline-styles and advance our markup with some help from Bootstrap...
- Load in Bootstrap CDN in `index.html`
- Modify UI to include Bootstrap classes
- Create a `styles` directory and make a file for your CSS rule definitions - this will be written in Javascript!
- Load in that file in any component and then use that to apply inline styling

# Intro to React.js

![react-logo](./images/react-white-logo.png)

## Learning Objectives

* Explain what a frontend framework is and why they can be helpful in writing more complex applications.
* Explain what ReactJS is and where it fits in our applications' stack.
* Explain the component model of web development.
* Create and render React components in the browser.

## Framing

### What is a Frontend Framework? 

- A framework is software providing generic functionality and structure that serves as foundation to build and deploy applications.
- Express is a framework that runs on the server, receiving incoming request from the client, preforming some work that you have defined, and returning some response to the client.  Front-end frameworks run in the client's browser, receive input from interactions with the page, perform some work that you have defined, and make any updates necessary.
- Frameworks can help standardize code, give you additional functionality and performance, and can help get your code off the ground faster.  
- There are [many](https://stateofjs.com/2017/front-end/) front end frameworks and each go about solving problems of how state is managed, updated, and represented by a view but there are many commonalities.
- There is a lot of debate over whether frontend frameworks count as frameworks at all -- some people say that they are just libraries and should be referred to as such.

### What is ReactJS?

React is a JavaScript library used to craft modern day UI and views for the front-end in web applications.

> **Selling Point:** By modeling small compatible components that focus on just rendering a view, we can move business logic out of the DOM, and therefore improve our app's performance, maintainability, modularity and readability.

#### Some History

The first thing most people hear about React is "Facebook uses it."
* First used by Facebook in 2011.
* Then Instagram in 2012.
* Went open source in May 2013.

**BEHOLD! The OLD FACEBOOK!** 

*2008*

<img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d4ypmybEZT8SAOj1efmy9CCkKwNG3Dd-Mv0__FoIsWgK0iWuYWBS4NPHOf71ANpKcx2ElOndGeiDInxm8p-sOMqNXBkPy3y-HsH45lGscqJepxFOYkU1_6BbAw' alt='old facebook' width='400px'>

*2011*

<img src='https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lNCcVZlrC08vdkMrMZ8XCGjD5a3w8yUybFm2YN7VJJzOttmEl99lR_bXcW21hw7AVtKDRvQajA4AsqJHVHqzhHnkNsVmMRXMvi9uuoV3iIU5gIJjSSkUee8fpg' alt='old facebook' width='400px'>

React was born out of Facebook's frustration with the traditional MVC model and how..
  * Re-rendering something meant re-rendering everything (or just a lot).
  * That had negative implications on processing power and ultimately user experience, which at times became glitchy and laggy.

> If you want to get a taste of what React is all about, [here's an introduction from React.js Conf 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVZ-P-ZI6W4&feature=youtu.be&t=510). Recommend starting around the 8:35 mark and watching until 16:30.

### React in MVC

React can be thought of as the "Views" layer.

React will work with any back-end language, but for project 3 and in our in-class examples we will be using Mongoose and Express for the models and controllers.

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is the role of a "view" in a front-end Javascript application?</strong></summary>
  The visual template the user sees, often populated with data from our models.
</details>

## Components

One comment made about React when it was first open sourced was "Rethinking established best practices" which kind of became the React motto.  In React, we want to move away from template pages, away from separating code based purely on file type, and more towards a **component-based** separation of concerns.  [Templates vs Components](https://wanderoak.co/fixed-templates-vs-components/)

![Templates Page](images/templates-page.png)
![Components Page](images/components-page.png)
> [WanderOak - Fixed Templates vs. Components](https://wanderoak.co/fixed-templates-vs-components/)

When taking a look at Facebook, you could think of each status post as a mini-component in React. And a list of those updates, is a component that contains several of those mini-components. You could take that one step further and think of the Facebook app, as one giant component with several components within it. (Things like the list of status updates, the friends list, the header, etc...)

Imagine you worked at Facebook when they wanted to shift from using likes to reactions. Using traditional JavaScript, HTML, and CSS the shift would make you have to change your code in a bunch of places. Component based architecture allows us to maintain our code more easily.

> [MakeTea - Building Robust Apps with React](http://maketea.co.uk/2014/03/05/building-robust-web-apps-with-react-part-1.html)

Notice the structure of how the various components are nested. 
```
- TubeTracker
    - Network
        - Line
    - Predictions
        - DepartureBoard
            - Trains
```

TubeTracker contains the application
Network displays each line on the network
Line displays the stations on a line
Predictions controls the state of the departure board
DepartureBoard displays the current station and platforms
Trains displays the trains due to arrive at a platform

### [F.I.R.S.T. Components](https://addyosmani.com/first/)

A React component is built to expect an input and render a UI with it. More importantly, a well-structured component only receives data specific to its purpose.

This is because React follows a more **functional** approach to programming. For React components under this approach, **the same input will always produce the same output**.

Best practice is that React components follow the **F.I.R.S.T.** guidelines

#### Focused

Components should do one thing and do it well.

#### Independent

Components should increase cohesion and reduce coupling. Behavior in one component should not impact the behavior of another. In other words, components should not rely on one another.

> But they should compliment one another.

#### Reusable

Components should be written in a way that reduces the duplication of code.

#### Small

Ideally, components should be short and condensed.

#### Testable

Because the same input will always produce the same output, components are easily unit testable.

> If you're interested, [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-react.html) is a popular testing library for React.


## Exercise: Identifying Components

* Break into groups of three and take a look at Facebook, Craigslist, Ebay, or a website of your choice. Identify the visual "components" the website is comprised of. Use markers to draw these out on the wall.

As you're drawing this out, think about the following questions...
* Where do you see "nested components"? Where do you not?
* Are there any components that share the same structure?
* Of these similar components, what is different about them?

## Initial Setup

In order to create a new project and to get our development environment setup, we are going to use the Terminal command `create-react-app`. It will create a new folder in your current directory for the in-class application.

`create-react-app` is an NPM package also built by Facebook that writes our build dependencies for us so that we can do less configuration. It allows us to use React, JSX, and ES6. It also allows us to import our CSS, it autoprefixes our CSS so that we don't have to worry about cross browser compatibility, it gives us a dev server to run, and it enables hot reloading which updates the code in our browser without us refreshing the page.

It uses Webpack which is a build tool that enables many of the features listed above. It also includes Babel which transpiles our JavaScript from ES6 to be compatible with older browsers. It also includes Autoprefixer for CSS compatibility, ESLint for linting, and Jest for testing.

You can also set up all this yourself, but for now `create-react-app` allows us to worry more about our code and less about configuration.

```bash
$ npm i -g create-react-app // this updates the most updated create-react-app npm pacakge
$ create-react-app blog-app
$ cd blog-app
$ code .
$ npm start
```

> Here you will begin setting up a blog app that you will continue working on during this lesson's exercises. For demonstration purposes, We will be creating a simple "hello world" app.

After running `$ npm start`, we can view the app at `http://localhost:3000`

`create-react-app` provides us with all the necessary tools and configuration necessary to start writing React. `npm start` refers to an included script that starts up the development server.

Along with installing the necessary dependencies, it creates an initial app skeleton that looks like this...

```bash
├──README.md
├──  favicon.ico
├──  index.html
├──  node_modules
├──  package.json
└──  src
    ├──  App.css
    ├──  App.js
    ├──  index.css
    ├──  index.js
    └──  logo.svg
```

Most of the important files, which are primarily the ones where we will be working today, are in the `/src` directory.

Take some time and look at what's been generated. Specifically look in `App.js` and `index.js`


### We Do: Hello World - A Very Basic Component

The basic unit you'll be working with in ReactJS is a **component**.

* Components can be thought of as functional elements that take in data and as a result, produce a dynamic UI.

Throughout class we have separated HTML, CSS and Javascript.
* With components, the lines between those three become a bit blurry.
* Instead, we organize our web apps according to small, reusable components that define their own content, presentation and behavior.  

What does a component look like? Let's start with a simple "Hello World" example...

To start, in our `/src/App.js` file, let's remove the contents and in its place add this component definition...

```js
// bring in React and Component instance from React
import React, {Component} from 'react'

// define our Hello component
class Hello extends Component {
  // what should the component render
  render () {
    // Make sure to return some UI
    return (
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    )
  }
}

export default Hello
```

Let's break down the things we see here...

##### `class Hello`
This is the component we're creating. In this example, we are creating a "Hello" component.

##### `extends Component`
This is the React library class we inherit from to create our component definition.

##### `render()`
Every component has, at minimum, a render method. It generates a **Virtual DOM** node that will be added to the actual DOM.
* Looks just like a regular ol' DOM node, but it's not yet attached to the DOM.

##### `export default Hello`
This exposes the Hello class to other files which import from the App.js file. The `default` keyword means that any import that's name doesn't match a named export will automatically revert to this. Only one default is allowed per file.

### JSX

> Hey you got your html in my javascript!
>
> You got your javascript in my html!
>
> (https://youtu.be/O7oD_oX-Gio?t=5s)

Let's talk about the value that the render method returns. It looks an awful lot like an HTML heading, but it's not. We often write out React components in JSX.

JSX is [a language that compiles to Javascipt](http://blog.yld.io/2015/06/10/getting-started-with-react-and-node-js/#.V8eDk5MrJPN) that allows us to write code that strongly resembles HTML. It is eventually compiled to lightweight JavaScript objects.

Your Hello component's render method:

* Currently returns JSX, not HTML.
The JSX creates a heading with 'Hello World!'.
* Your component reads this and renders a "Hello World!" heading.

> React can be written without JSX. If you want to learn more, [check out this blog post](http://jamesknelson.com/learn-raw-react-no-jsx-flux-es6-webpack/).  

Here is an example of React code without JSX-

![Templates Page](images/react-without-jsx.png)


## Virtual DOM 

You may have noticed that our `src/index.js` code mentions ReactDOM. ReactDOM doesn't refer to the same DOM we know. Instead, it refers to a Virtual DOM. The Virtual DOM is a key piece of how React works.

The Virtual DOM is a Javascript representation of the actual DOM. The virtual DOM is a staging area for changes that will eventually be implemented.

* Because of that, React can keep track of changes in the actual DOM by comparing different instances of the Virtual DOM.
* React then isolates the changes between old and new instances of the Virtual DOM and then only updates the actual DOM with the necessary changes.
* By only making the "necessary changes," as opposed to re-rendering an entire view altogether, we save up on processing power.
* This is not unlike Git, with which you compare the difference -- or `diff` -- between two commits.

![Virtual DOM Diagram](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/11ugBTwDkqn6p2n5Fkps1p3Elp8ZToIRzXzvM4LJMYaU/pub?w=543&h=229)

> If you're interested in learning more about the Virtual DOM, [check this video out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DX3vJiqxm4).

So we've created the template for our component. Now, let's use `/src/index.js` to load in our new component and render it on the DOM...

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import Hello from './App.js'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Hello />,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```
> In place of `ReactDOM.render` some tutorials will use React.renderComponent, which has been phased out. The change is outlined [here](http://bit.ly/1E81Whs).

`ReactDOM.render` takes the Virtual DOM node created by `extends Component` and adds it to the actual DOM. It takes two arguments...

  1. The component.
  2. The DOM element we want to append it to.

> **NOTE:** Whenever you use a self-closing tag in JSX, you **MUST** end it with a `/` like `<Hello />` in the above example.

---

### Hello World: A Little Dynamic

Our `Hello` component isn't too helpful. Let's make it more interesting.
* Rather than simply display "Hello world", let's display a greeting to the user.
* So the question is, how do we feed a name to our `Hello` component without hardcoding it into our render method?

First, we pass in data wherever we are rendering our component, in this case in `src/index.js`...

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import Hello from './App.js'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Hello name={"Nick"} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

Then in our component definition, we have a reference to that data via as a property on the `props` object...

```js
class Hello extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <h1>Hello {this.props.name}</h1>
    )
  }
}
```

In the above example, we replaced "world" with `{this.props.name}`.

#### What are `.props`?

Properties! Every component has `.props`
* Properties are immutable. That is, they cannot be changed while your program is running.
* We define properties in development and pass them in as attributes to the JSX element in our `.render` method.

First we can pass multiple properties to our component when its rendered in `src/index.js`..

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import Hello from './App.js'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Hello name={"Nick"} age={24} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

Then in our component definition we have access to both values...

```js
class Hello extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello {this.props.name}</h1>
        <p>You are {this.props.age} years old</p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

```

> **NOTE:** The return statement in `render` can only return one DOM element. You can, however, place multiple elements within a parent DOM element, like we do in the previous example with `<div>`.

---

## You Do: A Blog Post 

Let's have some practice creating a React component from scratch. How about a blog post?
* Create a `post` object literal in `src/index.js` above `ReactDOM.render()` that has the below properties.
  1. `title`
  2. `author`
  3. `body`
  4. `comments` (array of strings)
* Render these properties using a Post component.
* The composition of your Post is up to you.

If you finish early, try experimenting with CSS (Make Sure you use `className` instead of `class` in `JSX`!)

#### [Solution](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/simple-react-blog/commit/f1088165898d1a20df956647c8e9b5ed67d9ad32)

---


#### Q: What problems did you encounter when trying to add multiple comments to your Post?

It would be a pain to have to explicitly define every comment inside of `<Post />`, especially if each comment itself had multiple properties.
* This problem is a tell tale sign that our separation of concerns is being stretched, and it's time to break things into a new component.

We can nest a Comment component within a Post component.
* We create these comments the same way we did with posts: `extends Component` and `render`
* Then we can reference a comment using `<Comment />` inside of Post's render method.

Let's create a new file for our Comment component, `src/Comment.js`...

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react'

class Comment extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{this.props.message}</p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default Comment
```

Then in `src/App.js`, we need to load in our `Comment` component and render it inside of our `Post` component...

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
// Load in Comment component
import Comment from './Comment.js'


class Post extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
        <p>By {this.props.author}</p>
        <div>
          <p>{this.props.body}</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Comments:</h3>
        // Render Comment component, passing in data
        <Comment message={this.props.comments[0]} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Post;
```

> **Note**: We could put all of our code in one file, but it's considered a good practice to break components out into different files to help practice separation of concerns. The only downside is we have to be extra conscious of remembering to **export / import** each component to where it's rendered.

The above code works, but we'd have to hard-code all of our `Comments`.  This is not very dry and our code will not dynamically change.  The best way to handle this is to set a variable equal to all of the `<Comments />` for this post.  We can do this using `.map` in `Post's` `render` method.

We can use `.map` in `Post's` `render` method to avoid having to hard-code all of our `Comments`

```js
class Post extends Component {
  render() {
    let comments = this.props.comments.map((comment, index) => (
      <Comment message={comment} key={index}/>
    ))
    return(
      <div className='post-page'>
        <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
        <h2>By {this.props.author}</h2>
        <p>{this.props.body}</p>

        <h3>Comments</h3>
        {comments}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

### # Event Handlers and the Component Lifecycle in React

## Learning Objectives
* Understand how to use React's lifecycle methods
* Retrieve data from an API inside of a component
* Handle events in React
* Look at the React documentation to learn more

## Framing (10 min / 0:10)

So far, we've used react components to build simple applications. We've added state and props and controlled data flow through them (using just the render and setState methods). In order to do more complex things, we'll have to use lifecycle methods.

How do we get data from an API? Well we could drop in an AJAX call to fetch some data, but our component would likely render before the AJAX request finished. Our component would see that our data is `undefined` and either render a blank/empty component or throw an error.

How would we animate a component? (i.e. a sidebar that usually lives off the page, except for when a hamburger menu is pressed.) We could write some code to animate the position of the sidebar, but how could we guarantee it was running after our Sidebar component's render method had been called?

This lesson will walk us through the Component Lifecycle: hooks that are fired at different stages of a components "life" for solving the problems described above, as well as many others.

Throughout the course of this lesson, we'll build out a simple flashcard app with vocabulary keywords pulled from the Oxford Dictionary API. Our flashcard app will cycle through a set of flashcards, giving us 10 seconds to think of the definition before moving on to the next card.

But first, what is the Component Lifecycle?

## The Component Lifecycle (10 min / 0:20)

Components provide several lifecycle methods that you can use to control your application based on the state of the UI.

When you include these methods in the component they will be invoked automatically (because we are extending the React.Component class which has them already defined).

Lifecycle methods are called at specific points in the rendering process. You can use these methods to perform actions based on what's happening on the DOM.

* `componentWillUnmount` is called immediately *before* a component is removed from the DOM.
* `componentDidMount`, for example, is called immediately *after* a component is rendered to the DOM.

**What do you use lifecycle methods for?**

Making asynchronous requests (ajax calls), binding event listeners to components, animating components (once they've rendered), and optimizing for performance (shouldComponentUpdate).

**Why is it called a lifecycle?**
It's an action that repeats in a specific order.

![ ](./images/react_lifecycle_methods.png  "React-component-lifecycle")

### At a very high level

There are two types of component lifecycle methods:

* **Mounting** lifecycle methods. e.g. What happens when the component is created? Was an initial state set? Methods:
  - `constructor(props)`
  - `UNSAFE_componentWillMount()`
  - `static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`
  - `render()`
  - `componentDidMount()`

* **Updating** lifecycle methods. e.g. Has state changed? Methods:
  - `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps()`
  - `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`
  - `UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate()`
  - `render()`
  - `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`
  - `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)`
 
* **Unmounting** lifecycle method when the component is removed from DOM
  - `componentWillUnmount()`
	
The documentation gives good examples of what each method should be used for. [Check out the documentation on components!](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html)

## We do: Exploring the Lifecycle methods (20 min / 0:40)

Let's clone down [this repository](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-WDI/react-component-lifecycle/tree/master/react-component-lifecycle) with a short exercise for exploring the lifecycle methods.

This exercise is a simple, 2 "page" website where each page is a component. We'll be adding the component lifecycle methods to each page-component. As we do consider the following questions:

* What order are the methods run in? Before or after rendering?
* How many times is the method invoked?
* What causes the method to be (re)invoked?

> Add the mounting methods to HomePage.js and the update methods to AboutPage.js. console.log something in each method to understand the order.

### An Aside: Axios (10 min / 0:50)

For our first example of working with the component lifecycle methods, we'll be retrieving data from an API using AJAX.
AJAX calls are asynchronous, so we have to be mindful of how long our request will take and when our components will render.

We're going to use a module named `axios` to make our calls. Axios is a node module commonly used with React to send HTTP requests to an API. It functions much like jQuery's Ajax method, or window.Fetch(). Some benefits to using Axios:

* It is a promise-based library with an interface for simpler and cleaner syntax (compared to native XHR especially).
* It is lightweight and focused solely on handling HTTP requests (as opposed to jQuery which brings in an extensive set of new functions and methods)
* It is very configurable and has a number of useful methods for doing more complex requests from one or multiple API endpoints
* It handles a lot of the http header manual work for you (e.g. send a json file, it sets `Content-Type: application/json`)

Read more at the [Axios Documentation](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios)

> Note: Axios is just one of many Javascript libraries that we could use for handling requests. One of the big selling points of javascript is the ability to mix and match technologies according to preference. Other commonly-used tools for handling requests are fetch and jQuery.

> npm install axios --save

To load in the Axios module:

```js
// If you are using Babel to compile your code
import axios from 'axios'

# axios

[![Browser Matrix](https://saucelabs.com/open_sauce/build_matrix/axios.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/axios)

## Installing

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm install axios
```

Using bower:

```bash
$ bower install axios
```

Using cdn:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
```

## Example

Performing a `GET` request

```js
const axios = require('axios');

// Make a request for a user with a given ID
axios.get('/user?ID=12345')
  .then(function (response) {
    // handle success
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    // handle error
    console.log(error);
  })
  .then(function () {
    // always executed
  });

// Optionally the request above could also be done as
axios.get('/user', {
    params: {
      ID: 12345
    }
  })
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  })
  .then(function () {
    // always executed
  });  

// Want to use async/await? Add the `async` keyword to your outer function/method.
async function getUser() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('/user?ID=12345');
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

> **NOTE:** `async/await` is part of ECMAScript 2017 and is not supported in Internet
> Explorer and older browsers, so use with caution.

Performing a `POST` request

```js
axios.post('/user', {
    firstName: 'Fred',
    lastName: 'Flintstone'
  })
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

Performing multiple concurrent requests

```js
function getUserAccount() {
  return axios.get('/user/12345');
}

function getUserPermissions() {
  return axios.get('/user/12345/permissions');
}

axios.all([getUserAccount(), getUserPermissions()])
  .then(axios.spread(function (acct, perms) {
    // Both requests are now complete
  }));
```

## axios API

Requests can be made by passing the relevant config to `axios`.

##### axios(config)

```js
// Send a POST request
axios({
  method: 'post',
  url: '/user/12345',
  data: {
    firstName: 'Fred',
    lastName: 'Flintstone'
  }
});
```

```js
// GET request for remote image
axios({
  method:'get',
  url:'http://bit.ly/2mTM3nY',
  responseType:'stream'
})
  .then(function (response) {
    response.data.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('ada_lovelace.jpg'))
  });
```

##### axios(url[, config])

```js
// Send a GET request (default method)
axios('/user/12345');
```

### Request method aliases

For convenience aliases have been provided for all supported request methods.

##### axios.request(config)
##### axios.get(url[, config])
##### axios.delete(url[, config])
##### axios.head(url[, config])
##### axios.options(url[, config])
##### axios.post(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios.put(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios.patch(url[, data[, config]])

###### NOTE
When using the alias methods `url`, `method`, and `data` properties don't need to be specified in config.

### Concurrency

Helper functions for dealing with concurrent requests.

##### axios.all(iterable)
##### axios.spread(callback)

### Creating an instance

You can create a new instance of axios with a custom config.

##### axios.create([config])

```js
const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://some-domain.com/api/',
  timeout: 1000,
  headers: {'X-Custom-Header': 'foobar'}
});
```

### Instance methods

The available instance methods are listed below. The specified config will be merged with the instance config.

##### axios#request(config)
##### axios#get(url[, config])
##### axios#delete(url[, config])
##### axios#head(url[, config])
##### axios#options(url[, config])
##### axios#post(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios#put(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios#patch(url[, data[, config]])
##### axios#getUri([config])

## Request Config

These are the available config options for making requests. Only the `url` is required. Requests will default to `GET` if `method` is not specified.

```js
{
  // `url` is the server URL that will be used for the request
  url: '/user',

  // `method` is the request method to be used when making the request
  method: 'get', // default

  // `baseURL` will be prepended to `url` unless `url` is absolute.
  // It can be convenient to set `baseURL` for an instance of axios to pass relative URLs
  // to methods of that instance.
  baseURL: 'https://some-domain.com/api/',

  // `transformRequest` allows changes to the request data before it is sent to the server
  // This is only applicable for request methods 'PUT', 'POST', and 'PATCH'
  // The last function in the array must return a string or an instance of Buffer, ArrayBuffer,
  // FormData or Stream
  // You may modify the headers object.
  transformRequest: [function (data, headers) {
    // Do whatever you want to transform the data

    return data;
  }],

  // `transformResponse` allows changes to the response data to be made before
  // it is passed to then/catch
  transformResponse: [function (data) {
    // Do whatever you want to transform the data

    return data;
  }],

  // `headers` are custom headers to be sent
  headers: {'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest'},

  // `params` are the URL parameters to be sent with the request
  // Must be a plain object or a URLSearchParams object
  params: {
    ID: 12345
  },

  // `paramsSerializer` is an optional function in charge of serializing `params`
  // (e.g. https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs, http://api.jquery.com/jquery.param/)
  paramsSerializer: function (params) {
    return Qs.stringify(params, {arrayFormat: 'brackets'})
  },

  // `data` is the data to be sent as the request body
  // Only applicable for request methods 'PUT', 'POST', and 'PATCH'
  // When no `transformRequest` is set, must be of one of the following types:
  // - string, plain object, ArrayBuffer, ArrayBufferView, URLSearchParams
  // - Browser only: FormData, File, Blob
  // - Node only: Stream, Buffer
  data: {
    firstName: 'Fred'
  },

  // `timeout` specifies the number of milliseconds before the request times out.
  // If the request takes longer than `timeout`, the request will be aborted.
  timeout: 1000, // default is `0` (no timeout)

  // `withCredentials` indicates whether or not cross-site Access-Control requests
  // should be made using credentials
  withCredentials: false, // default

  // `adapter` allows custom handling of requests which makes testing easier.
  // Return a promise and supply a valid response (see lib/adapters/README.md).
  adapter: function (config) {
    /* ... */
  },

  // `auth` indicates that HTTP Basic auth should be used, and supplies credentials.
  // This will set an `Authorization` header, overwriting any existing
  // `Authorization` custom headers you have set using `headers`.
  auth: {
    username: 'janedoe',
    password: 's00pers3cret'
  },

  // `responseType` indicates the type of data that the server will respond with
  // options are 'arraybuffer', 'blob', 'document', 'json', 'text', 'stream'
  responseType: 'json', // default

  // `responseEncoding` indicates encoding to use for decoding responses
  // Note: Ignored for `responseType` of 'stream' or client-side requests
  responseEncoding: 'utf8', // default

  // `xsrfCookieName` is the name of the cookie to use as a value for xsrf token
  xsrfCookieName: 'XSRF-TOKEN', // default

  // `xsrfHeaderName` is the name of the http header that carries the xsrf token value
  xsrfHeaderName: 'X-XSRF-TOKEN', // default

  // `onUploadProgress` allows handling of progress events for uploads
  onUploadProgress: function (progressEvent) {
    // Do whatever you want with the native progress event
  },

  // `onDownloadProgress` allows handling of progress events for downloads
  onDownloadProgress: function (progressEvent) {
    // Do whatever you want with the native progress event
  },

  // `maxContentLength` defines the max size of the http response content in bytes allowed
  maxContentLength: 2000,

  // `validateStatus` defines whether to resolve or reject the promise for a given
  // HTTP response status code. If `validateStatus` returns `true` (or is set to `null`
  // or `undefined`), the promise will be resolved; otherwise, the promise will be
  // rejected.
  validateStatus: function (status) {
    return status >= 200 && status < 300; // default
  },

  // `maxRedirects` defines the maximum number of redirects to follow in node.js.
  // If set to 0, no redirects will be followed.
  maxRedirects: 5, // default

  // `socketPath` defines a UNIX Socket to be used in node.js.
  // e.g. '/var/run/docker.sock' to send requests to the docker daemon.
  // Only either `socketPath` or `proxy` can be specified.
  // If both are specified, `socketPath` is used.
  socketPath: null, // default

  // `httpAgent` and `httpsAgent` define a custom agent to be used when performing http
  // and https requests, respectively, in node.js. This allows options to be added like
  // `keepAlive` that are not enabled by default.
  httpAgent: new http.Agent({ keepAlive: true }),
  httpsAgent: new https.Agent({ keepAlive: true }),

  // 'proxy' defines the hostname and port of the proxy server.
  // You can also define your proxy using the conventional `http_proxy` and
  // `https_proxy` environment variables. If you are using environment variables
  // for your proxy configuration, you can also define a `no_proxy` environment
  // variable as a comma-separated list of domains that should not be proxied.
  // Use `false` to disable proxies, ignoring environment variables.
  // `auth` indicates that HTTP Basic auth should be used to connect to the proxy, and
  // supplies credentials.
  // This will set an `Proxy-Authorization` header, overwriting any existing
  // `Proxy-Authorization` custom headers you have set using `headers`.
  proxy: {
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 9000,
    auth: {
      username: 'mikeymike',
      password: 'rapunz3l'
    }
  },

  // `cancelToken` specifies a cancel token that can be used to cancel the request
  // (see Cancellation section below for details)
  cancelToken: new CancelToken(function (cancel) {
  })
}
```

## Response Schema

The response for a request contains the following information.

```js
{
  // `data` is the response that was provided by the server
  data: {},

  // `status` is the HTTP status code from the server response
  status: 200,

  // `statusText` is the HTTP status message from the server response
  statusText: 'OK',

  // `headers` the headers that the server responded with
  // All header names are lower cased
  headers: {},

  // `config` is the config that was provided to `axios` for the request
  config: {},

  // `request` is the request that generated this response
  // It is the last ClientRequest instance in node.js (in redirects)
  // and an XMLHttpRequest instance the browser
  request: {}
}
```

When using `then`, you will receive the response as follows:

```js
axios.get('/user/12345')
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response.data);
    console.log(response.status);
    console.log(response.statusText);
    console.log(response.headers);
    console.log(response.config);
  });
```

When using `catch`, or passing a [rejection callback](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then) as second parameter of `then`, the response will be available through the `error` object as explained in the [Handling Errors](#handling-errors) section.

## Config Defaults

You can specify config defaults that will be applied to every request.

### Global axios defaults

```js
axios.defaults.baseURL = 'https://api.example.com';
axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = AUTH_TOKEN;
axios.defaults.headers.post['Content-Type'] = 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded';
```

### Custom instance defaults

```js
// Set config defaults when creating the instance
const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.example.com'
});

// Alter defaults after instance has been created
instance.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = AUTH_TOKEN;
```

### Config order of precedence

Config will be merged with an order of precedence. The order is library defaults found in [lib/defaults.js](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/master/lib/defaults.js#L28), then `defaults` property of the instance, and finally `config` argument for the request. The latter will take precedence over the former. Here's an example.

```js
// Create an instance using the config defaults provided by the library
// At this point the timeout config value is `0` as is the default for the library
const instance = axios.create();

// Override timeout default for the library
// Now all requests using this instance will wait 2.5 seconds before timing out
instance.defaults.timeout = 2500;

// Override timeout for this request as it's known to take a long time
instance.get('/longRequest', {
  timeout: 5000
});
```

## Interceptors

You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by `then` or `catch`.

```js
// Add a request interceptor
axios.interceptors.request.use(function (config) {
    // Do something before request is sent
    return config;
  }, function (error) {
    // Do something with request error
    return Promise.reject(error);
  });

// Add a response interceptor
axios.interceptors.response.use(function (response) {
    // Do something with response data
    return response;
  }, function (error) {
    // Do something with response error
    return Promise.reject(error);
  });
```

If you may need to remove an interceptor later you can.

```js
const myInterceptor = axios.interceptors.request.use(function () {/*...*/});
axios.interceptors.request.eject(myInterceptor);
```

You can add interceptors to a custom instance of axios.

```js
const instance = axios.create();
instance.interceptors.request.use(function () {/*...*/});
```

## Handling Errors

```js
axios.get('/user/12345')
  .catch(function (error) {
    if (error.response) {
      // The request was made and the server responded with a status code
      // that falls out of the range of 2xx
      console.log(error.response.data);
      console.log(error.response.status);
      console.log(error.response.headers);
    } else if (error.request) {
      // The request was made but no response was received
      // `error.request` is an instance of XMLHttpRequest in the browser and an instance of
      // http.ClientRequest in node.js
      console.log(error.request);
    } else {
      // Something happened in setting up the request that triggered an Error
      console.log('Error', error.message);
    }
    console.log(error.config);
  });
```

You can define a custom HTTP status code error range using the `validateStatus` config option.

```js
axios.get('/user/12345', {
  validateStatus: function (status) {
    return status < 500; // Reject only if the status code is greater than or equal to 500
  }
})
```

## Cancellation

You can cancel a request using a *cancel token*.

> The axios cancel token API is based on the withdrawn [cancelable promises proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-cancelable-promises).

You can create a cancel token using the `CancelToken.source` factory as shown below:

```js
const CancelToken = axios.CancelToken;
const source = CancelToken.source();

axios.get('/user/12345', {
  cancelToken: source.token
}).catch(function (thrown) {
  if (axios.isCancel(thrown)) {
    console.log('Request canceled', thrown.message);
  } else {
    // handle error
  }
});

axios.post('/user/12345', {
  name: 'new name'
}, {
  cancelToken: source.token
})

// cancel the request (the message parameter is optional)
source.cancel('Operation canceled by the user.');
```

You can also create a cancel token by passing an executor function to the `CancelToken` constructor:

```js
const CancelToken = axios.CancelToken;
let cancel;

axios.get('/user/12345', {
  cancelToken: new CancelToken(function executor(c) {
    // An executor function receives a cancel function as a parameter
    cancel = c;
  })
});

// cancel the request
cancel();
```

> Note: you can cancel several requests with the same cancel token.

## Using application/x-www-form-urlencoded format

By default, axios serializes JavaScript objects to `JSON`. To send data in the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` format instead, you can use one of the following options.

### Browser

In a browser, you can use the [`URLSearchParams`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) API as follows:

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams();
params.append('param1', 'value1');
params.append('param2', 'value2');
axios.post('/foo', params);
```

> Note that `URLSearchParams` is not supported by all browsers (see [caniuse.com](http://www.caniuse.com/#feat=urlsearchparams)), but there is a [polyfill](https://github.com/WebReflection/url-search-params) available (make sure to polyfill the global environment).

Alternatively, you can encode data using the [`qs`](https://github.com/ljharb/qs) library:

```js
const qs = require('qs');
axios.post('/foo', qs.stringify({ 'bar': 123 }));
```

Or in another way (ES6),

```js
import qs from 'qs';
const data = { 'bar': 123 };
const options = {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
  data: qs.stringify(data),
  url,
};
axios(options);
```

### Node.js

In node.js, you can use the [`querystring`](https://nodejs.org/api/querystring.html) module as follows:

```js
const querystring = require('querystring');
axios.post('http://something.com/', querystring.stringify({ foo: 'bar' }));
```

You can also use the [`qs`](https://github.com/ljharb/qs) library.

###### NOTE
The `qs` library is preferable if you need to stringify nested objects, as the `querystring` method has known issues with that use case (https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/1665).

## Semver

Until axios reaches a `1.0` release, breaking changes will be released with a new minor version. For example `0.5.1`, and `0.5.4` will have the same API, but `0.6.0` will have breaking changes.

## Promises

axios depends on a native ES6 Promise implementation to be [supported](http://caniuse.com/promises).
If your environment doesn't support ES6 Promises, you can [polyfill](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise).

## TypeScript
axios includes [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org) definitions.
```typescript
import axios from 'axios';
axios.get('/user?ID=12345');
```

// In standard vanilla Javascript
let axios = require('axios')
```

To use Axios to query an API at a given url endpoint:

```js
axios.get('url')
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response)
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error)
  })
```

<!-- You can also append values to the parameters by passing in a second input to `.get()`:

```js
  axios.get('url', {
    params: {
      key1: value1,
      key2: value2
    }
  })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response)
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error)
  })
```

Which would result in a GET request to: `url?key1=value1&key2=value2`.

<!-- ### We Do: Axios and AJAX inside a React Component:
> 15 min / 1:05

We will be using Axios to query the PokéAPI in [this exercise](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-exercises/react-components-axios). -->

## Flashcards (90 min / 2:30)

As we dive deeper in to each of the component lifecycle methods and what they're used for, we'll work through the following exercise to create a simple flashcards app.

The starter code for this exercise can be found [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-WDI/flashcards).

Let's go ahead and clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-WDI/flashcards
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The app we're going to build will pull characters from a dictionary API and create a flashcard for each word and definition`. The app will then cycle through each word, giving the user 10 seconds to think of the definition before moving on to the next card. 

The solution code is [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-WDI/flashcards/tree/solution)

### We Do: Adding the Flashcard Container

#### Use Axios to query the dictionary API

<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>

```js
// FlashcardContainer.js

class FlashcardContainer extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super(); 

    this.state = {
      flashcards: [],
      currentIndex: 0
    }
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    axios.get(CLIENT_URL)
      .then((response) => {
          console.log(response)
          this.setState({flashcards: response.data})
        })
  }

  render() {
    let detail = this.state.flashcards[this.state.currentIndex]
    let card;

    if(detail) {
      card = <Flashcard detail={detail}/>
    }

    return (
      <div>
        {card}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

</details>

The componentDidMount method is called once, immediately after your component is rendered to the DOM. If you want to make an AJAX request when your component first renders, this is where to do it (not in the constructor, or in componentWillMount). componentWillMount shouldn't be used for server requests because it may be invoked multiple times before render. Side effects should be avoided in the constructor, and so server requests shouldn't be made there.

#### Add an event listener to switch between cards

<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>

```js
//FlashcardContainer.js

class FlashcardContainer extends Component {
  state = {
      flashcards: [],
      currentIndex: 0
    }

  // increment currentIndex
  next () {
    let nextIndex = (this.state.currentIndex + 1) === this.state.flashcards.length
      ? this.state.currentIndex
      : this.state.currentIndex + 1

    this.setState({currentIndex: nextIndex})
  }

  // decremement currentIndex
  prev () {
    let prevIndex = (this.state.currentIndex - 1) < 0
      ? 0
      : (this.state.currentIndex - 1)

    this.setState({currentIndex: prevIndex})
  }

  // callback to be used in the event listener below
  handleKeyUp (event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 39) this.next()
    if (event.keyCode === 37) this.prev()
  }

  componentDidMount () {
    window.addEventListener('keyup', this.handleKeyUp)

    axios
      .get(CLIENT_URL)
      .then(response => this.setState({flashcards: response.data}))
      .catch(err => console.log(err))
  }

  render() {
    let detail = this.state.flashcards[this.state.currentIndex]
    let card;

    if(detail) {
      card = <Flashcard detail={detail}/>
    }

    return (
      <div>
        {card}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

</details>

In this example, we have added a constructor that has a few initial state properties. We also add an event listener that switches to the next card on right arrow press. Finally, we add an API pull to fetch the dynamic data we will use for the app.

### You Do: Adding a Timer to the Flashcard

Add a timer to the Flashcard Detail component.

* Initialize the timer to have 10 seconds on it
* Every second the same flashcard is still on the board, remove a second from it
> **hint**: use `setInterval()`)
* When the timer reaches zero, switch to the next card
> **hint**: where did you define the `next()` method? How can you access it from `Flashcard.js`?
* When the `Flashcard` component receives a new card, restart the timer


#### We Do: Adding the Definition Component

Now that we have our flashcard displayed, lets add their definitions as well.

For this, we will use a pure functional component -- or a component created by a function instead of a class -- and then change its style dynamically based on its index.

<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>

```js
//Definition.js

import React from 'react';

let Definition = (props) => {

	return (
		<div className="">
			<p>{props.def}</p>
		</div>
	)
}

export default Definition;
```

```js
// Flashcard.js
...
class Flashcard extends Component {
  render() {
    let defs = this.props.detail.definitions[0].definitions 

    return (
      <div class="card">
        <p>{this.props.detail.word}</p>
        { defs.map(def => <Definition def={def} /> )}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
...
```

</details>

## You Do: Show or Hide the Definition

Add a button that, when clicked, toggles whether or not the definition card is displayed on the page.

## Event Handlers
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/react-component-lifecycle/edit/master/readme.md

Throughout the last few classes, you've seen a couple event handlers. These look similar to including them inline in HTML.

In the React Intro class, we went over how we are not actually interacting directly with the DOM when we write React code, rather, we are interacting with the virtualDOM. Because of this, when we call an event listener, we use `SyntheticEvent`'s instead of the usual event objects we are used to dealing with in JQuery events. We still get all of the same properties attached to them, and some additional ones. Because of this, the traditional documentation on event handlers is sometimes not accurate. Instead, use the React event handling documentation found [here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html). Spend a few minutes looking at the different events on listed here.

**See Headers Below For Step By Step Outline**

> **Note**: each step has a corresponding commit with the implemented actions on the solution branch of this repo.

### Step 0a: Examine the Solution

Take a look at the [completed app here](https://react-giphy-app.herokuapp.com/) repo.

Spend time playing around with the completed exercise. Think about how you would separate your different components and functionality.


### Step 0b: Create React App

Create a new React app called react-giphy.

Remove everything from `Index.js` and `App.js`.

Now go ahead and setup `Index.js` and `App.js` from scratch (look at docs or previous labs if you need to).


### Step 1: Set up a `HelloWorld` Component

Before we start building our React app, let's create a `HelloWorld` component just to make sure that we've tied everything together properly.  

- In your `/src` directory, configure your `App.js` and `index.js` files to render a `HelloWorld` component.
- Run `npm start` and make sure everything is working (sanity check).

### Step 2: Add UI for Home

- Rename `App.js` to `Home.js` to better indicate the purpose of the file. Make sure to update references to this file elsewhere in your application accordingly.
- Create a Home component that returns a container `<div>` element, which should in turn contain a `<h1>` element.
- Render that component to the DOM in your app's main `index.js` file

### Step 3: Add UI for Search

- Create a new file for your `Search` component.
- Define a `Search` component that renders a search form. This can be a simple form with a single input and submit button.
- Import the `Search` file to your `Home` file.
- Render the `Search` component in the `Home` component.

### Step 4: Wire up the Search Button

- Define your `Search` component's initial state. It should have a `query` value that corresponds to a search term.
- Define a function that is triggered whenever the user submits the Search form. Start by just logging `"searched!"` to make sure it works.
  - Use an event listener to attach this function to your form. Try googling `onSubmit`.
- Define a function that updates your `query` value in state whenever a change is made to the input field. You can do this using an `onInput` function on your text box, or by using `ref`.
- Update your submit function so that it now logs the `query` value in state.

### Step 5: Move search logic to a `SearchContainer` component

- Create a new `SearchContainer` component that that renders the `Search` component. This `SearchContainer` will also handle search results. 
- Refactor your `Search` component so that it only renders a UI. It should use properties passed into the Search component.
- Move all of the business logic related to state for the search into the `SearchContainer` component. The `SearchContainer` component should still render the `Search` component, with any necessary properties.

### Step 6: When a User Searches...

- Define a `Results` component that will take in a collection of gif objects and render each one's `source` url as well as a fixed height image.  Go ahead an look at the [Giphy search documentation](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/) to see the structure of the JSON it sends.
- Update your `SearchContainer` component's state to include whether the user has submitted a search.
- Update `SearchContainer`'s state to include a list of results.
- If a user has searched, instead of rendering the `Search` component, render a `Results` component with hard coded data.
- This is starting to look like a single page app, but we don't have routing yet. If you'd like, update the component so that the search bar and any results are always displayed on the page, and clear out old results when a new search is submitted. 


<details><summary>click for simplified hard-coded gif data you could use</summary>

```js
{
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "gif",
      "id": "iuHaJ0D7macZq",
      "url": "http://giphy.com/gifs/cat-day-tomorrow-iuHaJ0D7macZq",
      "source": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CatGifs/comments/5f0h9a/tomorrow_is_legs_day/",

        }
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "gif",
      "id": "Z1kpfgtHmpWHS",
      "url": "http://giphy.com/gifs/cat-way-make-Z1kpfgtHmpWHS",

      "rating": "g",
      "images": {
        "fixed_height": {
          "url": "http://media4.giphy.com/media/Z1kpfgtHmpWHS/200.gif"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "status": 200,
    "msg": "OK"
  },
  "pagination": {
    "total_count": 1947,
    "count": 25,
    "offset": 0
  }
}
```

</details>

### Step 7: Search the Giphy API

- With the API we're using, you will need to [register for an API key](https://developers.giphy.com/). The API key is free, and only takes a minute or two to setup.
- Go ahead an look at the [documentation](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/) to determine the API's proper usage.
- We're going to be searching the giphy API based on a word or phrase to return a collection of results.
- Load in Axios, and use it to make an HTTP request to the API search endpoint using the user's query.
- Pass the data to the Results component to be displayed.

### Step 8: 

- Lets get rid of Search button and call the external API whenever User is entering string to search (Hint: you may have to make some changes in onInput()).
- Now that you have that working, lets introduce some performance optimization. Make changes such that component is only re-rendered if the User changes the search string (Hint: use a lifecycle hook. Also, you may have to set the value of `state.query` in another method).
- After you have made these changes you will notice that even though you are not re-rendering the component, but your app is still making the third-party API call. Use one of the other lifecycle hooks to prevent that from happening (Hint: think about componentDidUpdate() lifecycle method).

You can view the solution [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-WDI/react-giphy-lab/tree/solution).

### Step 9: Add Styles to your React app

- Load in Bootstrap CDN in `index.html`.
- Modify UI to include Bootstrap classes.
- Create a `styles` directory and make a file for your CSS rule definitions - this will be written in Javascript!.
- Load in that file in any component and then use that to apply inline styling.

### Step 10: Add a single result detail component

- Create a `Details` component that renders information about a single gif.
- When a user clicks on a  gif in the results view, render the detail UI.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Intro to React Router

For this lesson, students should:

- Understand components
- Understand state and props

The first part is a demonstration of how Router works. Students can then work on each lab and the challenges.

## Learning Objectives
- Learn about routing with react-router
<!-- - Using data from APIs and JSON files -->
<!-- - Create a Stock Trading app -->

## Preparation

First, we'll create a new app to learn how React Router works.

1. Create a new react app: `create-react-app learn-react-router`
2. `cd learn-react-router`
3. `npm install react-router-dom`

Once we're done learning the basics, students can clone this repository and use the starter files to get started with the labs.

## What is React Router?

React Router is a module that makes it easy to make single page apps (SPAs). SPAs are web apps which load different sections of a website within the same page. The user feels as though they've never left the homepage because links swap out content and replace it with new content.

The main components of the router are:

1. `BrowserRouter`: The module that stores all the routes for the app as well as route history, current location and url.
2. `Route`: Used to define each individual route by relating each path to a specific component.

Since `BrowserRouter` is the parent component, we'll configure it in `index.js`. It would look like this:

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import {
  BrowserRouter as Router
} from "react-router-dom"

import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router>
    <App />
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Update `index.js` to include this code.

Next, let's add some routes. Open `App.js` and let's add let's import the routing components we'll need first.

```
import {
    Route,
    Link,
    Switch
} from 'react-router-dom'
```

- `Route` is used to connect paths to components
- `Link` is used to create links to `Route` paths.
- `Switch` will find the *first* route to match a given path. Once found, it will stop looking, just like a Javascript switch statement

Now we need some routes. But first, let's create a new component that we can attach to a route:

<details>
<summary>About.js</summary>

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class About extends Component {
    render () {
        return (
            <div>
                All about stocks. Read it here, folks!
            </div>
        )
    }
}

export default About;
```

<summary>App.js</summary>

```diff
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './styles/App.css';
import {
    Route,
    Link,
    Switch
} from 'react-router-dom'

+ import About from './About';

class App extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
+           <header>
+               <h1>Learn Routing</h1>
+               <nav>
+                   {/* Create our nav bar links using the Link element from react router */}
+                   <ul>
+                       <li><Link to="/about">About</Link></li>
+                   </ul>
+               </nav>

                {/* Create the routes. This will not appear on the page. */}
+               <div className="main">
+                   <Switch>
+                       <Route path="/about" component={ About } />
+                   </Switch>
+               </div>
+           </header>
        );
    }
}

export default App;

```

</details>

Done. We've successfully added a link to a route in our app. Try visiting the route in the browser!

Try adding a route back to the homepage. Don't worry about content for now!

- This is starting to look like a single page app, but we don't have routing yet. If you'd like, update the component so that the search bar and any results are always displayed on the page, and clear out old results when a new search is submitted.

### Step 7: Search the Giphy API

- With the API we're using, you will need to [register for an API key](https://developers.giphy.com/). The API key is free, and only takes a minute or two to setup.
- Go ahead an look at the [documentation](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/) to determine the API's proper usage.
- We're going to be searching the giphy API based on a word or phrase to return a collection of results.
- Load in Axios, and use it to make an HTTP request to the API search endpoint using the user's query.
- Pass the data to the Results component to be displayed.

### Step 8: 

- Lets get rid of Search button and call the external API whenever User is entering string to search (Hint: you may have to make some changes in onInput()).
- Now that you have that working, lets introduce some performance optimization. Make changes such that component is only re-rendered if the User changes the search string (Hint: use a lifecycle hook. Also, you may have to set the value of `state.query` in another method).
- After you have made these changes you will notice that even though you are not re-rendering the component, but your app is still making the third-party API call. Use one of the other lifecycle hooks to prevent that from happening (Hint: think about componentDidUpdate() lifecycle method).

You can view the solution [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-WDI/react-giphy-lab/tree/solution).

### Step 9: Add Styles to your React app

- Load in Bootstrap CDN in `index.html`.
- Modify UI to include Bootstrap classes.
- Create a `styles` directory and make a file for your CSS rule definitions - this will be written in Javascript!.
- Load in that file in any component and then use that to apply inline styling.

### Step 10: Add a single result detail component

- Create a `Details` component that renders information about a single gif.
- When a user clicks on a  gif in the results view, render the detail UI.

  # Event Handlers and the Component Lifecycle in React

## Learning Objectives
* Understand how to use React's lifecycle methods
* Retrieve data from an API inside of a component
* Handle events in React
* Look at the React documentation to learn more

## Framing (10 min / 0:10)

So far, we've used react components to build simple applications. We've added state and props and controlled data flow through them (using just the render and setState methods). In order to do more complex things, we'll have to use lifecycle methods.

How do we get data from an API? Well we could drop in an AJAX call to fetch some data, but our component would likely render before the AJAX request finished. Our component would see that our data is `undefined` and either render a blank/empty component or throw an error.

How would we animate a component? (i.e. a sidebar that usually lives off the page, except for when a hamburger menu is pressed.) We could write some code to animate the position of the sidebar, but how could we guarantee it was running after our Sidebar component's render method had been called?

This lesson will walk us through the Component Lifecycle: hooks that are fired at different stages of a components "life" for solving the problems described above, as well as many others.

Throughout the course of this lesson, we'll build out a simple flashcard app with vocabulary keywords pulled from the Oxford Dictionary API. Our flashcard app will cycle through a set of flashcards, giving us 10 seconds to think of the definition before moving on to the next card.

But first, what is the Component Lifecycle?

## The Component Lifecycle (10 min / 0:20)

Components provide several lifecycle methods that you can use to control your application based on the state of the UI.

When you include these methods in the component they will be invoked automatically (because we are extending the React.Component class which has them already defined).

Lifecycle methods are called at specific points in the rendering process. You can use these methods to perform actions based on what's happening on the DOM.

* `componentWillUnmount` is called immediately *before* a component is removed from the DOM.
* `componentDidMount`, for example, is called immediately *after* a component is rendered to the DOM.

**What do you use lifecycle methods for?**

Making asynchronous requests (ajax calls), binding event listeners to components, animating components (once they've rendered), and optimizing for performance (shouldComponentUpdate).

**Why is it called a lifecycle?**
It's an action that repeats in a specific order.

![ ](./images/react_lifecycle_methods.png  "React-component-lifecycle")

### At a very high level

There are two types of component lifecycle methods:

* **Mounting** lifecycle methods. e.g. What happens when the component is created? Was an initial state set? Methods:
  - `constructor(props)`
  - `UNSAFE_componentWillMount()`
  - `static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`
  - `render()`
  - `componentDidMount()`

* **Updating** lifecycle methods. e.g. Has state changed? Methods:
  - `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps()`
  - `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`
  - `UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate()`
  - `render()`
  - `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`
  - `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)`
 
* **Unmounting** lifecycle method when the component is removed from DOM
  - `componentWillUnmount()`
	
The documentation gives good examples of what each method should be used for. [Check out the documentation on components!](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html)

## We do: Exploring the Lifecycle methods (20 min / 0:40)

Let's clone down [this repository](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-WDI/react-component-lifecycle/tree/master/react-component-lifecycle) with a short exercise for exploring the lifecycle methods.

This exercise is a simple, 2 "page" website where each page is a component. We'll be adding the component lifecycle methods to each page-component. As we do consider the following questions:

* What order are the methods run in? Before or after rendering?
* How many times is the method invoked?
* What causes the method to be (re)invoked?

> Add the mounting methods to HomePage.js and the update methods to AboutPage.js. console.log something in each method to understand the order.

### An Aside: Axios (10 min / 0:50)

For our first example of working with the component lifecycle methods, we'll be retrieving data from an API using AJAX.
AJAX calls are asynchronous, so we have to be mindful of how long our request will take and when our components will render.

We're going to use a module named `axios` to make our calls. Axios is a node module commonly used with React to send HTTP requests to an API. It functions much like jQuery's Ajax method, or window.Fetch(). Some benefits to using Axios:

* It is a promise-based library with an interface for simpler and cleaner syntax (compared to native XHR especially).
* It is lightweight and focused solely on handling HTTP requests (as opposed to jQuery which brings in an extensive set of new functions and methods)
* It is very configurable and has a number of useful methods for doing more complex requests from one or multiple API endpoints
* It handles a lot of the http header manual work for you (e.g. send a json file, it sets `Content-Type: application/json`)

Read more at the [Axios Documentation](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios)

> Note: Axios is just one of many Javascript libraries that we could use for handling requests. One of the big selling points of javascript is the ability to mix and match technologies according to preference. Other commonly-used tools for handling requests are fetch and jQuery.

To load in the Axios module:
> npm i axios --save

```js
// If you are using Babel to compile your code
import axios from 'axios'

// In standard vanilla Javascript
let axios = require('axios')
```

To use Axios to query an API at a given url endpoint:

```js
axios.get('url')
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response)
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error)
  })
```

<!-- You can also append values to the parameters by passing in a second input to `.get()`:

```js
  axios.get('url', {
    params: {
      key1: value1,
      key2: value2
    }
  })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response)
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error)
  })
```

Which would result in a GET request to: `url?key1=value1&key2=value2`.
 -->

<!-- ### We Do: Axios and AJAX inside a React Component:
> 15 min / 1:05

We will be using Axios to query the PokéAPI in [this exercise](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-exercises/react-components-axios). -->

## Flashcards (90 min / 2:30)

As we dive deeper in to each of the component lifecycle methods and what they're used for, we'll work through the following exercise to create a simple flashcards app.

The starter code for this exercise can be found [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-WDI/flashcards).

Let's go ahead and clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-WDI/flashcards
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The app we're going to build will pull characters from a dictionary API and create a flashcard for each word and definition`. The app will then cycle through each word, giving the user 10 seconds to think of the definition before moving on to the next card. 

The solution code is [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-WDI/flashcards/tree/solution)

### We Do: Adding the Flashcard Container

#### Use Axios to query the dictionary API

<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>

```js
// FlashcardContainer.js

class FlashcardContainer extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super(); 

    this.state = {
      flashcards: [],
      currentIndex: 0
    }
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    axios.get(CLIENT_URL)
      .then((response) => {
          console.log(response)
          this.setState({flashcards: response.data})
        })
  }

  render() {
    let detail = this.state.flashcards[this.state.currentIndex]
    let card;

    if(detail) {
      card = <Flashcard detail={detail}/>
    }

    return (
      <div>
        {card}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

</details>

The componentDidMount method is called once, immediately after your component is rendered to the DOM. If you want to make an AJAX request when your component first renders, this is where to do it (not in the constructor, or in componentWillMount). componentWillMount shouldn't be used for server requests because it may be invoked multiple times before render. Side effects should be avoided in the constructor, and so server requests shouldn't be made there.

#### Add an event listener to switch between cards

<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>

```js
//FlashcardContainer.js

class FlashcardContainer extends Component {
  state = {
      flashcards: [],
      currentIndex: 0
    }

  // increment currentIndex
  next () {
    let nextIndex = (this.state.currentIndex + 1) === this.state.flashcards.length
      ? this.state.currentIndex
      : this.state.currentIndex + 1

    this.setState({currentIndex: nextIndex})
  }

  // decremement currentIndex
  prev () {
    let prevIndex = (this.state.currentIndex - 1) < 0
      ? 0
      : (this.state.currentIndex - 1)

    this.setState({currentIndex: prevIndex})
  }

  // callback to be used in the event listener below
  handleKeyUp (event) {
    if (event.keyCode === 39) this.next()
    if (event.keyCode === 37) this.prev()
  }

  componentDidMount () {
    window.addEventListener('keyup', this.handleKeyUp)

    axios
      .get(CLIENT_URL)
      .then(response => this.setState({flashcards: response.data}))
      .catch(err => console.log(err))
  }

  render() {
    let detail = this.state.flashcards[this.state.currentIndex]
    let card;

    if(detail) {
      card = <Flashcard detail={detail}/>
    }

    return (
      <div>
        {card}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

</details>

In this example, we have added a constructor that has a few initial state properties. We also add an event listener that switches to the next card on right arrow press. Finally, we add an API pull to fetch the dynamic data we will use for the app.

### You Do: Adding a Timer to the Flashcard

Add a timer to the Flashcard Detail component.

* Initialize the timer to have 10 seconds on it
* Every second the same flashcard is still on the board, remove a second from it
> **hint**: use `setInterval()`)
* When the timer reaches zero, switch to the next card
> **hint**: where did you define the `next()` method? How can you access it from `Flashcard.js`?
* When the `Flashcard` component receives a new card, restart the timer


#### We Do: Adding the Definition Component

Now that we have our flashcard displayed, lets add their definitions as well.

For this, we will use a pure functional component -- or a component created by a function instead of a class -- and then change its style dynamically based on its index.

<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>

```js
//Definition.js

import React from 'react';

let Definition = (props) => {

	return (
		<div className="">
			<p>{props.def}</p>
		</div>
	)
}

export default Definition;
```

```js
// Flashcard.js
...
class Flashcard extends Component {
  render() {
    let defs = this.props.detail.definitions[0].definitions 

    return (
      <div class="card">
        <p>{this.props.detail.word}</p>
        { defs.map(def => <Definition def={def} /> )}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
...
```

</details>

## You Do: Show or Hide the Definition

Add a button that, when clicked, toggles whether or not the definition card is displayed on the page.

## React Documentation

* What is an uncontrolled component in React? Why would we use it instead of a controlled one?
* Describe 1-way and 2-way data binding. Which model does React use? Explain and compare to other popular front-end frameworks.
* Describe how to best gather information from a form in React. Be prepared to show code!
* Compare and contrast stateful, stateless, and functional components in React. List the pros and cons of each. When would we use one over the other?

## Bonus



## Event Handlers

Throughout the last few classes, you've seen a couple event handlers. These look similar to including them inline in HTML.

In the React Intro class, we went over how we are not actually interacting directly with the DOM when we write React code, rather, we are interacting with the virtualDOM. Because of this, when we call an event listener, we use `SyntheticEvent`'s instead of the usual event objects we are used to dealing with in JQuery events. We still get all of the same properties attached to them, and some additional ones. Because of this, the traditional documentation on event handlers is sometimes not accurate. Instead, use the React event handling documentation found [here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html). Spend a few minutes looking at the different events on listed here.


# JSON Web tokens and YOU!

## So What Is It?


A web token (for use in Auth) is a compact, contained way to securely send information between a database and a user's computer as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

So why is this important? 

Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the token, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. This way a customer does not have to manually reverify everytime they make a change.  

## Token Structure

In its simple form, a token is separated by 3 parts and will look as so

```
Header.Payload.Signature
```
Each section of the token is encoded by the base64url encoding algorithm for compression. 

Check out how that works [HERE](https://simplycalc.com/base64url-encode.php)

### Header

The header consists of two parts. The type (JWT) and Algorithm being used (such as HMAC, SHA256, or RSA)
 
```json
{
	"alg": "HS256",
	"typ":"JWT"
}
```

encoded it turns into...

```
ewoJImFsZyI6ICJIUzI1NiIsCgkidHlwIjoiSldUIgp9
```
	
### Payload
The payload is a container that holds the "claims" about the user. A "claim" is a dataset inside the token that holds information about the user and what the user can handle. There are 3 main types of claims.

- Registered claims
	* These are predefined claims that are not mandatory but recommended. Provides a set of useful claims about the user. 
	* I.E. expiration time to define how long until a user needs a new token.
- Public claims
	* These are openly defined claims that you can make yourself. It is a good idea to stick to the standards set by the [Token Regitry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml).
- Private claims	
	* These are custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them and are not already a registered claim or a public claim. 

So it will look similar to
	
```json
{
	"sub":"12345678",
	"name": "Bobbo",
	"admin": true,
}
	
```

encoded it looks like...

```
ewoJInN1YiI6IjEyMzQ1Njc4IiwKCSJuYW1lIjogIkJvYmJvIiwKCSJhZG1pbiI6IHRydWUKfQ
```

### Signature

Now, this is where the magic comes in. To creat the signature you take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, and the algorithm specified in the header and sign that. 

when you encode that it looks something like this..

```
4pcPyMD09o1PSyXCjTwXyr4BsezdI1AVTmud2fU4

```

This is to verify that the message was not changed along the way to either the user or back the database. 

### Lets put it all together now

So when you combine all three you get this looooooooooooong 3 point string. That is what is passed back and forth between both database and client. 

```
ewoJImFsZyI6ICJIUzI1NiIsCgkidHlwIjoiSldUIgp9.ewoJInN1YiI6IjEyMzQ1Njc4IiwKCSJuYW1lIjogIkJvYmJvIiwKCSJhZG1pbiI6IHRydWUKfQ.4pcPyMD09o1PSyXCjTwXyr4BsezdI1AVTmud2fU4
```

## How do they work?

In Auth, a web token is returned when a user successfully "logs in" using their credentials. So upon login, the token is sent to the client from the database and stored in local storage. 

From there anytime the client wants to be **Authorized** it will send the Token to the database that will then check the Token for its **Authorization** and then allow the client to access the correct routes.

One way to understand this is by thinking of an arcade machine. When you go to an arcade and want to play a game you must insert a token to get started. Once started you have been **Authorized** to play the game. 

![arcade gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/o2su0spy4u2zK/giphy.gif)

Now as you are playing if you were to die in the game then you would have to insert more tokens *within the time limit* to continue your **Authorization** and continue the same character. If you do not then you will not be **Authorized** anymore to play. 

### How do they get sent?

A user sends the token along with their request to access the page. Inside of the request, object is the header object that will hold the **Authorization** header. The **Authorization** header looks as so..

```
Authorization: Bearer <ridiculous token string>
```

From here the token is grabbed and then cross-referenced with the token data held for the user in the database. If the information is valid then the user is **Authorized**.

Now that is a lot to take in. So let's look at the documentation flowchart to get a better understanding.

# React: Authentication with JWTs

## Learning Objectives
- Describe JSON web tokens (JWTs)
- Identify parts of JWTs
- Add JWT authentication with Passport to a MERN app

## Framing

### What is a JSON Web Token?

[Official definition](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519): compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. 

In other words: A JSON web token is JSON-formatted data sent securely between the server and the browser via HTTP requests. 

### Authentication with JWTs

The problem that JWTs seek to overcome: HTTP is stateless, but we need a way to tell the server that a user is logged in.

When making requests or performing actions that are only for authorized users, there needs to be a way to keep track of whether a user is logged in, since that information isn't stored in HTTP by nature. 

For instance, when we implemented Passport for user authentication, we used sessions to remind the server of "logged-in status" with every request made to the server. A session is a place to store data on the browser during one request which can be read during later requests. The session is a JS object that allows us to keep track of this information. When a new user signs into an application, we create a new session in the server, and a cookie for this session is sent in a response back to the browser. In future HTTP requests from the browser, the client sends a session cookie to the server to retrieve the user from the database to then authenticate the authorized interaction with the database (e.g. saving a post, editing data).

Another approach to keeping track of a user being logged in is to use JWTs with Passport. With JWTs, the user info is embedded in a token. Upon initial log in, the server creates a JSON "token" to store the user info. These tokens are "signed" by the server, and only the server holds the private key to read the token.

#### How It Works

![JWT vs. Sessions Diagram](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*d6YcPvq7TeU0DTamj629xw.png)

1. Client browser makes a request sending user login credentials and password (only has to do this once)
2. Server validates the credentials and sends a JSON response to the client that encodes user login data
3. Client stores this JSON web token
4. When the client sends a request to a route that requires authentication, it will send this token to the API to present its authorization for access

#### Advantages of using JWTs:

- JWTs are self-contained
    - You have all the information about the user within the token. After inital request from browser, the server doesn't need to interact with the database to know who the user is. Using JWTs limit database lookups.
- JWTs are compact, and transmission through HTTP actions is fast.
- JWTs work the same for browser clients and native mobile apps.

### What does a JWT look like?

A string with three parts, each separated by dots (`.`):

    - header
    - payload
    - signature

#### Header

**Header** is a JSON object consisting of two parts: the type of token (typ) and the hashing algorithm being used on the token (alg).

```js
Header example:
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

#### Payload

**Payload** is a JSON object containing claims. Claims refer to statements about an entity (e.g. user data). You can put as many claims into the payload as you want, though you want to be cognizant of keeping the JWT compact so as not to impact performance of HTTP actions.

```js
Payload example:
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "userId": "5z-9328477bz"
  "admin": true
}
```

There are three different types of claims: public claims, private claims, and registered claims.

Registered claims refer to claims that have predetermined key names - e.g. common fields like issuer ("iss"), subject ("sub"), and expiration time ("exp").

Public claims are claims that we create - e.g. "name", "userId", and "admin" above.

Private claims are used when JWTs are sent between two parties. Only these two parties know what the claims respresent.

#### Signature
**Signature** is encoded header and payload signed with a secret key.

The header is encoded, and the payload is encoded. They are joined together with a `.` in between. This string is then hashed with the server's secret key, using header's hashing algorithm. This produces a new string, which is added onto the `<header>.<payload>` string with another `.` between.

The signature allows the receiver to ensure that the JWT was sent from an authentic source (the holder of the secret key). This encoding does not serve to encrypt the data, but to transform the data.

> Note: [Refresher on difference between encoding, encrypting, and hashing.](https://danielmiessler.com/study/encoding-encryption-hashing-obfuscation/)

#### Final product

Encoded string vs. decoded JSON:

![JWT: encoded string vs. decoded JSON](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*LAo6s2tlszZdk2x-uE1lqA.png)

### Using JWTs with Passport in a MERN app

Passport allows you to store the user object in requests instead of in session cookies. Upon the log-in request, the server will create a token and pass it to the browser in the HTTP response. The token is saved to local storage in the browser.

When the user wants to access a route that requires authorization, the client will send a JWT with the request to the server. Since the server has the secret key to decode the JWT, it can (a) verify that the JWT has the right signature to ensure that the JWT originally came from that server, and (b) verify the user and then perform the action that needed authorization.

### User Controller

In order to log in (or sign up), we'll need to make post requests to the server to find (or create) the user in the database and create a JWT to represent the user is logged in. We can manage these requests in a user controller.


#### Sign Up

We will begin creating routes for requests made from the browser. First, we will build out functionality for a `post` request to `/users/signup`. The logic involved is:

- Receive sign-up form input (email and password) from the browser
- Query the database to see if another user has used that email
- If not, create an instance in the database with new user email and password
- Generate a JWT holding the user id
- Send the JWT back to the browser

In `/controllers/user.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
	signup : (req, res) => {
        console.log(req.body);
        // Check to see if email is already in db
        db.User.find({email: req.body.email})
          .exec()
          .then( user => {
            // if a user is found with that email
            if (user.length >= 1) {
              // send an error and let the user know that the email already exists
              return res.status(409).json({
                message: "email already exists"
              })
            // if we don't have this user's email in our db, lets get them set up!
            } else {
              // lets hash our plaintext password
              bcrypt.hash(req.body.password, 10, (err, hash) => {
                if(err){ 
                  console.log("hashing error:", err);
                  res.status(200).json({error: err})
                // we now have a successful hashed password
                } else {
                  // we are creating a User object with their email address and OUR hashed password
                  db.User.create({
                    email: req.body.email,
                    password: hash
                  }, (err, newUser) => {
                      console.log('here is the result',newUser)
                    // if(err){ return res.status(500).json({err})}
                    // we send our new data back to user or whatever you want to do.
                    let user ={
                      email: newUser.email,
                      _id: newUser._id
                    } 
                    
                  jwt.sign(
                      user,
                      "waffles",
                      {
                        // its good practice to have an expiration amount for jwt tokens.
                        expiresIn: "1h"
                      },
                      (err, signedJwt) => {
                      res.status(200).json({
                        message: 'User Created',
                        user,
                        signedJwt
                      })
                    });
                    // send success back to user, along with a token.
                  })
                }
              })
            }
          })
          .catch( err => {
            console.log(err);
            res.status(500).json({err})
          })
      },
}
```

#### Testing Sign Up with Postman 

To verify that this post request will work, let's use our nifty tool, Postman. Start up the server with `nodemon`.

In Postman:

- Choose POST verb
- Url: `http://localhost:3001/user/signup`
- Headers: 
    - Key: 'Content-Type'
    - Value: 'application/json'
- Body:
    - Raw
    - JSON (application/json)
    - ```js
        {
            "email": "meg@email.com",
            "password": "meg123"
        }
        ```

Hit "SEND"!

Then, scroll down to see the server response. You should see a JSON object with a token value.


#### Log In

In the user controller, we will create a method to handle `post` requests to create a token when a user logs in. It will:

- Receive sign-up form input (email and password) from the browser
- Query the database for that user
- Verify the password sent from the browser matches the password in the database
- Generate a JWT holding the user id
- Send the JWT back to the browser

In `/controllers/user.js` below signup:

```js
login: (req, res) => {
        console.log("LOGIN CALLED");
        // find the user in our user db
        console.log("body", req.body)
        db.User.find({email: req.body.email})
          .select('+password')
          .exec()
          // if we have found a user
          .then( users => {
            // if there is not email in our db
            console.log("USERS: ", users);
            if(users.length < 1) {
              return res.status(401).json({
                message: "Email/Password incorrect"
              })
            }
            // we have an email in our db that matches what they gave us
            // now we have to compare their hashed password to what we have in our db
            console.log("body", req.body);
            console.log("hash", users[0].password);
            bcrypt.compare(req.body.password, users[0].password, (err, match) => {
              console.log(match)
              // If the compare function breaks, let them know
              if(err){console.log(err);return res.status(500).json({err})}
              // If match is true (their password matches our db password)
              if(match){
                console.log("MATCH: ", match)
                // create a json web token

                let user ={
                  email: users[0].email,
                  _id: users[0]._id
                } 
                jwt.sign(
                  user,
                  "waffles",
                  {
                    // its good practice to have an expiration amount for jwt tokens.
                    expiresIn: "1h"
                  },
                  (err, signedJwt) => {
                  res.status(200).json({
                    message: 'Auth successful',
                    user,
                    signedJwt
                  })
                });
              // the password provided does not match the password on file.
              } else {
                console.log("NOT A MATCH")
                res.status(401).json({message: "Email/Password incorrect"})
              }
            })
      
      
          })
          .catch( err => {
            console.log("OUTSIDE ERROR_")
            console.log(err);
            res.status(500).json({err})
          })
        },
```

#### Testing Log In with Postman 
In Postman:

- Choose POST verb
- Url: `http://localhost:3001/user/login`
- Headers: 
    - Key: 'Content-Type'
    - Value: 'application/json'
- Body:
    - Raw
    - JSON (application/json)
    - ```js
        {
            "email": "meg@email.com",
            "password": "meg123"
        }
        ```

Hit "SEND"!

Once again, you should see a JSON object with a token value sent in a response.

### Front End: Log In and Sign Up

#### Starter Code 

Clone down [this repository](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-WDI/react-walk-it-out-front-end.git) for the front-end of `Walk It Out`. **(Make sure you're out of the back end repo!)**

```bash
$ git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-WDI/react-walk-it-out-front-end.git
$ cd react-walk-it-out-front-end
$ npm i
```

Take 5 minutes to review the starter code. Look through:

- components
- any API calls
- forms

#### Sign Up 

When you go to the starter code in the `SignUpForm.js` component, you'll see that the form input fields fire off a few different methods. When the methods start with `this.props.` you know the methods have been passed through from the parent component (in this case, `App.js`).

In `App.js`, the method for `handleInput` is already defined.

Next we need to code functionality for the `handleSignUp` method. Given that this form is taking user input to be put into the database, we'll want to make an `axios` request to the server. In `App.js` in `handleSignUp`:

```javascript
  handleSignUp = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    axios.post('http://localhost:3001/user/signup', 
			{ email: this.state.email,
      	password: this.state.password }
			)
      .then( response => {
        console.log(response)
        localStorage.token = response.data.signedJwt
          this.setState({
            isLoggedIn: true
          })
      })
      .catch(err => console.log(err))
  }
```

This takes the input from the form and creates a new user with that information. Per our set up on the back end, the server sends a token back to the browser in response.

In your command line, start up the app in the browser with `npm start` to test out the sign up feature.

> More on the [localStorage object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)

#### Log Out

When you've gained the ability to sign up, you'll want to incorporate logging out functionality. Refer to the `LogOut.js` component.

In `LogOut.js`, you'll see a form firing `this.props.handleLogOut`. To give this method functionality, fill in the `handleLogOut` method in `App.js`:

```javascript
handleLogOut = () => {
  this.setState({
    email: '',
    password: '',
    isLoggedIn: false
  })
  localStorage.clear()
}
```

This sets the email and password properties in state back to empty strings, changes the state `isLoggedIn` property to false, and clears the localStorage of JWTs.

#### Log In 
The final functionality we need is the
 ability to log in. In the `LogInForm.js` component, there is a form that uses `handleInput` (already written) and `handleLogIn` (needs to be written) methods in the parent component.

In `App.js`, fill out the `handleLogIn` method with:

```javascript
handleLogIn = (e) => {
	e.preventDefault()
	axios.post('http://localhost:3001/user/login', {
		email: this.state.email,
		password: this.state.password
	})
	.then( response => {
		localStorage.token = response.data.signedJwt
		this.setState({
			isLoggedIn: true
		})
	})
	.catch(err => console.log(err))
}
```

As written in the back-end code, this has the server verify the user information with the database and creates a JWT token to be passed back to the browser, which is then stored in localStorage.

Your app now has functionality to sign up, log out, and log in, using passport authentication with JWTs.

      	password: this.state.password }
			)
      .then( response => {
        console.log(response)
        localStorage.token = response.data.signedJwt
          this.setState({
            isLoggedIn: true
          })
      })
      .catch(err => console.log(err))
  }

express docu: 
https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html

var express = require('express')
var app = express()

// respond with "hello world" when a GET request is made to the homepage
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('hello world')
})
Route methods
A route method is derived from one of the HTTP methods, and is attached to an instance of the express class.

The following code is an example of routes that are defined for the GET and the POST methods to the root of the app.

// GET method route
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('GET request to the homepage')
})

// POST method route
app.post('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('POST request to the homepage')
})
Express supports methods that correspond to all HTTP request methods: get, post, and so on. For a full list, see app.METHOD.

There is a special routing method, app.all(), used to load middleware functions at a path for all HTTP request methods. For example, the following handler is executed for requests to the route “/secret” whether using GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or any other HTTP request method supported in the http module.

app.all('/secret', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('Accessing the secret section ...')
  next() // pass control to the next handler
})
Route paths
Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made. Route paths can be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions.

The characters ?, +, *, and () are subsets of their regular expression counterparts. The hyphen (-) and the dot (.) are interpreted literally by string-based paths.

If you need to use the dollar character ($) in a path string, enclose it escaped within ([ and ]). For example, the path string for requests at “/data/$book”, would be “/data/([\$])book”.

Express uses path-to-regexp for matching the route paths; see the path-to-regexp documentation for all the possibilities in defining route paths. Express Route Tester is a handy tool for testing basic Express routes, although it does not support pattern matching.

Query strings are not part of the route path.

Here are some examples of route paths based on strings.

This route path will match requests to the root route, /.

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('root')
})
This route path will match requests to /about.

app.get('/about', function (req, res) {
  res.send('about')
})
This route path will match requests to /random.text.

app.get('/random.text', function (req, res) {
  res.send('random.text')
})
Here are some examples of route paths based on string patterns.

This route path will match acd and abcd.

app.get('/ab?cd', function (req, res) {
  res.send('ab?cd')
})
This route path will match abcd, abbcd, abbbcd, and so on.

app.get('/ab+cd', function (req, res) {
  res.send('ab+cd')
})
This route path will match abcd, abxcd, abRANDOMcd, ab123cd, and so on.

app.get('/ab*cd', function (req, res) {
  res.send('ab*cd')
})
This route path will match /abe and /abcde.

app.get('/ab(cd)?e', function (req, res) {
  res.send('ab(cd)?e')
})
Examples of route paths based on regular expressions:

This route path will match anything with an “a” in it.

app.get(/a/, function (req, res) {
  res.send('/a/')
})
This route path will match butterfly and dragonfly, but not butterflyman, dragonflyman, and so on.

app.get(/.*fly$/, function (req, res) {
  res.send('/.*fly$/')
})
Route parameters
Route parameters are named URL segments that are used to capture the values specified at their position in the URL. The captured values are populated in the req.params object, with the name of the route parameter specified in the path as their respective keys.

Route path: /users/:userId/books/:bookId
Request URL: http://localhost:3000/users/34/books/8989
req.params: { "userId": "34", "bookId": "8989" }
To define routes with route parameters, simply specify the route parameters in the path of the route as shown below.

app.get('/users/:userId/books/:bookId', function (req, res) {
  res.send(req.params)
})
The name of route parameters must be made up of “word characters” ([A-Za-z0-9_]).

Since the hyphen (-) and the dot (.) are interpreted literally, they can be used along with route parameters for useful purposes.

Route path: /flights/:from-:to
Request URL: http://localhost:3000/flights/LAX-SFO
req.params: { "from": "LAX", "to": "SFO" }
Route path: /plantae/:genus.:species
Request URL: http://localhost:3000/plantae/Prunus.persica
req.params: { "genus": "Prunus", "species": "persica" }
To have more control over the exact string that can be matched by a route parameter, you can append a regular expression in parentheses (()):

Route path: /user/:userId(\d+)
Request URL: http://localhost:3000/user/42
req.params: {"userId": "42"}

how to run express app
1) require the express (remember to npm i express too!)
2) app.get("/", function(req, res) {
    res.send("hi there");
  }
3) listen for it on port (https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app.listen)

- cloud9 express port
//  special for cloud9 env variabl process.env.PORT
> app.listen(process.env.PORT, process.env.IP);

// import module express
var express = require("express");
// include all express content inside of app variable!
var app = express();

// 3 diff routes, 3 places!
// when request is made to / root path
app.get("/", function(req, res) {
    res.send("hi there");
    
});
// "/" hi there
// "/bye" bye bye
// "/dog" meow?

// Tell express to listen for requests (start server)

  * parent https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/react_todo_walkthrough

  - # Sprint 0: Getting Started

Now let's create the react app. We're going to be using the library `react-router-dom` for this, so we will need to install that as well.

```bash
$ create-react-app my-react-todo
$ cd my-react-todo
$ npm i react-router-dom
$ npm start
```

Now, if we navigate to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) we will see the boilerplate create-react-app React application.

### First Step - Hello World

#### Get rid of things we won't use

Let's remove the following files from the `src` folder:

```bash
$ rm src/App.css
$ rm src/App.test.js
$ rm src/logo.svg
```

> you could also remove the favicon, just make sure you remove the reference to it from `index.html` as well

Then replace the return block inside `src/App.js` with a header of Hello World. The whole file should look like this:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="container">
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

> Hooray for automatic rerendering on save! If we just switch over to our browser we'll automatically see our updates.

Now on to [Sprint 1: React Router setup](Sprint1.md)

- sprint todo: 
# Sprint 2: Containers

Writing a container is going to feel very similar to writing just another component. Remember that React components should be FIRST: focused, independent, reusable, small, and testable. In order to help keep components slim, a good practice is to move as much of the *business logic* surrounding a component's state to a container component. We're going to put all that logic in this container. It will start out very similarly to our `Header` component, but end up much more complex.

Let's revise our `src/containers/TodosContainer.js` and replace the dummy text we had before with the following:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'

class TodosContainer extends Component {
  render(){
    return (
      <div className='todosContainer'>
        <h2>This is the todos container</h2>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default TodosContainer
```

### PAUSE!

Everything up to this point is most of what you need to know about using react for a simple website NOT using a back-end.  From here on out we will be writing code to communicate with our back-end api `super-crud`. 

We can still access our originating `index.html` page to include cdn links.  Lets add two fonts from Google's Fonts API. Add this above the other `<link>` tags in the `<head>` tag

```html

<!-- in public/index.html: -->
  <link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Rokkitt' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
  <link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:700,600,400' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
```


Just add css through `index.css` and you're good to go! Here's some basic style:

You'll notice that React errors out! We need to add a background image that our `css` file is looking for.  In this repository you'll find an `assets` folder with the image. Move this file into an `images` folder in your `src` folder.

The file looks a little wonky but we'll grow up it real nice!

Now on to [Sprint 3: Fetching data with Axios](Sprint3.md)

-  react Axios
# Sprint 3: Fetching Data with Axios

React actually isn't as full featured as say AngularJS or BackboneJS. It relies on third party libraries to fetch data. Today, we'll be using a library called [Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios), a promise based HTTP client for the browser and node. This replaces the need for JQuery and Ajax. Let's install the module now and also create the folder & file that will contain our database logic:

```bash
$ npm i axios 
$ mkdir src/models
$ touch src/models/Todo.js
```

Now in `src/models/Todo.js`, we are going to use our beloved super-crud API endpoint of todos to get some data (you can check out the raw json at https://super-crud-api.herokuapp.com/api/todos):

```js
import axios from 'axios'

const endPoint = `https://super-crud-api.herokuapp.com/api/todos`

class TodoModel {
  static all(){
    let request = axios.get(endPoint)
    return request
  }
}

export default TodoModel
```

The Axios API is awesome & intuitive! When we use the `all` method on our `TodoModel`, it will make a get request to our API for *all* todos. We return the request so that we can chain promises to it.

Note also that `all()` is a static method. What does this mean? A **static** method can be called without there being an **instance** of the class containing the **static** method. This will allow us to call `all()` in the following way (without ***instantiating*** the class with new):

```js
let todos = TodoModel.all()
```


**Class methods** don't require an instance of the class in order to be called, but an **instance method** does. [More on Static Methods in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Static_methods)

We can't really test out the code in this file in isolation, so we must `import` it into our application in order to test it. The logical place to import this code is in the `TodosContainer` component.

For now, let's toss this in the `TodosContainer`'s `render()` method: this isn't ultimately going to be where we want to call `TodoModel.all()`, but for testing purposes, it will suffice.

In `containers/TodosContainer.js`:

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react'
import TodoModel from '../models/Todo'

class TodosContainer extends Component {
  render(){
    TodoModel.all().then( (res) => {
      console.log(res);
    })
    return (
      <div className='todosContainer'>
        <h2>This is a todos container</h2>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default TodosContainer
```

Awesome, we can see the response from our database as soon as the page loads, we know it's working! Notice that the actual `json` we want is stored in the `data` attribute of the response.  This is a standard format for `axios` returns.  

We can now see that everything is working! However, its completely in the wrong spot and we don't have anything we're passing todos to... yet!

Now that we can get our data, let's code how we present that data. It'll be a bit before we connect these pieces and actually see our todos in our app, but just hold on, we'll get there!

### Rendering A Todo
Let's start at the bottom and bubble up. It would be nice if each `todo` element had its own component to follow FIRST(Focused Independent Reusable Small Testable) principles. Let's create `src/components/Todo.js` and put the following in it:

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react'

class Todo extends Component {
  render(){
    return(
      <li data-todos-index={this.props.todo.id}>
        <span>{this.props.todo.body}</span>
      </li> 
    )
  }
}

export default Todo
```

When we write this component we know that if we pass it a `todo`, as a `prop`, that has both an id and a body, that it will render. AND it will render the same way every time. So what will be rendering each individual `Todo` component?

### Rendering Todos
We need another component. Its responsibility will be to render all of the todos. Let's create another component `src/components/Todos.js` and fill it with the following:

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react'
import Todo from './Todo'

class Todos extends Component {
  render(){

    let todos = this.props.todos.map( (todo) => {
      return (
        <Todo
          key={todo._id}
          todo={todo}/>
      )
    })

    return(
      <ul>
        {todos}
      </ul>
    )
    
  }
}

export default Todos
```

In this component, we have a property called todos. When we eventually use this component, we need to pass it that property. Once we have our todos, it takes each one and maps a `Todo` component to the variable `todos`. Then renders all of the todos. We can use the map function to render multiple components for each individual todo and store them in a variable. We just need to make sure we bind `this` in case we need to access properties from the `Todos` component later.

### Putting it all together, at last! Todos

Let's shove the remaining code we need in and then let's talk about it. In `src/containers/TodosContainer.js`:

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react'
import TodoModel from '../models/Todo'
import Todos from '../components/Todos'

class TodosContainer extends Component {
  constructor(){
    super()
    this.state = {
      todos: []
    }
  }
  componentDidMount(){
    this.fetchData()
  }
  fetchData(){
    TodoModel.all().then( (res) => {
      this.setState ({
        todos: res.data.todos,
        todo: ''
      })
    })
  }
  render(){
    return (
      <div className="todosComponent">
        <Todos
          todos={this.state.todos} />
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default TodosContainer
```

If we take a look at our browser now... BAM todos! What just happened....

```js
constructor(){
  super()
  this.state = {
    todos: []
  }
}
```

This is just like `__init__` in python(only a bit different). `constructor()` is basically a function that invokes when an instance of our class gets initialized. When we call `super()` we're basically saying invoke the same `constructor` function that the React library defines for their `constructor`. In addition to that initialize a state for this component in which `todos` is a property and set its value as an empty array. We can then set the state any other time in our application using `.setState()`.

```js
fetchData(){
  TodoModel.all().then( (res) => {
    this.setState ({
      todos: res.data.todos,
      todo: ''
    })
  })
}
```

This function leverages our model to retrieve our `todos` from our backend. In the promise of that request we set the state of this container component to have `todos` be the value returned from the response. Any time `setState` is invoked the component re-renders.

```js
componentDidMount(){
  this.fetchData()
}
```

### Hooks
Every component in react undergoes a component lifecycle. There are several "hooks" throughout this lifecycle. You can think of hooks like events that we can trigger functionality on. `componentDidMount` is a reserved hook that happens after a component renders. There are many hooks, this is a [great blog post](http://busypeoples.github.io/post/react-component-lifecycle/) that goes into much better detail of the lifecycle of a component.


You might be asking yourself: "Wait, why are we getting the data after the components already been rendered?" ([Andy did too](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39338464/reactjs-why-is-the-convention-to-fetch-data-on-componentdidmount))

That's because a re-render will always happen because fetching data happens asynchronously. Here's the [Facebook recommendation](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentwillmount)

### Passing State from parents to children
How have we passed state? What do we mean by state with reference to a react component? The state of the `TodosContainer` is simple, the todos. How does each individual todo know about the todo they need to render? From the state of the most parent container, `TodosContainer`.

If we take a look at the `props` being passed from one component to the next, we can clearly see the chain of how information was passed.

In `src/containers/TodosContainer.js`:


```javascript  
<Todos
  todos={this.state.todos} />
```

In `src/components/Todos.js`:  

```js
  let todos = this.props.todos.map( (todo) => {
  return (
    <Todo
      key={todo.id}
      todo={todo}
    />
  )
})
```

In `src/components/Todo.js`:

```js
  <li data-todos-index={this.props.todo.id}>
    <span>{this.props.todo.body}</span>
  </li> 
```

### PAUSE - Why is this awesome?
We could stop the lesson here and take this knowledge and build lots of cool things with it. Most of the API's developers have access to are read-only. That said, if we know an endpoint to get data, we now know how to use React to display that data.

### sprint 5
## Sprint 5: Deleting Todos

Deleting will work similarly with regard to passing state. Let's update the `Todo` component to contain a UI with which to delete a todo. In `src/components/Todo.js`:

```js
class Todo extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
  deleteClickedTodo = () => {
    this.props.deleteTodo(this.props.todo);
  }
  render(){
    return(
      <li data-todos-index={this.props.todo.id}>
        <span>{this.props.todo.body}</span>
        <a
          className='remove'
          onClick={this.deleteClickedTodo}>
          Remove
        </a>
      </li> 
    )
  }
}
```

We've added an anchor tag with an `remove` in it. When it gets clicked it invokes the `deleteTodo` function defined on `props`. That means we need to pass `.deleteTodo` as `props` from the parent component of `Todos`. In `src/components/Todos.js`

```js
let todos = this.props.todos.map( (todo) => {
  return (
    <Todo
      key={todo._id}
      todo={todo}
      deleteTodo={this.props.deleteTodo}/>
  )
})
```

Looks like it's not defined here either but passed yet again from a parent container. Finally in the `src/containers/TodosContainer.js`:

```js
constructor() {
  super();
  this.state = {
    todos: []
  }
}

// After the todo delete response is sent back from the server, we find the corresponding entry for the todo in our todos state array and remove it.
deleteTodo = (todo) => {
    TodoModel.delete(todo).then((res) => {
        let todos = this.state.todos.filter(function(todo) {
          return todo._id !== res.data._id
        });
        this.setState({todos})
    })
}

render(){
  return (
    <div className="todosComponent">
      <CreateTodoForm
        createTodo={this.createTodo}
        />
      <Todos
        todos={this.state.todos}
        deleteTodo={this.deleteTodo}
        />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Before we talk about the above code, lets look at what delete looks like in our `TodoModel`. In `src/models/Todo.js`:

```js
  static delete(todo){
    let request = axios.delete(`${endPoint}/${todo._id}`)
    return request
  }
```

The `deleteTodo` takes the todo, passed from the child Component of `Todo` up through a chain of references. It deletes it with axios. Upon deletion, all todos are grabbed from the container state and filters out the one deleted, updates the state to have only the remaining todos.


And now the final frontier! [Sprint 6: Editing and Updating Todos!](Sprint6.md)
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/react_todo_walkthrough/edit/master/sprints/Sprint5.md

## Sprint 4: Creating Todos
We're going to want to create a component that handles the form for creating todos. Before we build this feature out, How can we pass state from a child component to a parent? The opposite is easy, because we're able to just pass properties to our child components. Child state to parent state is much more difficult because we can't pass properties like that. Its unidirectional. The answer? Callbacks.

Lets write this feature to shed some more light on it.

Let's create a file `src/components/CreateTodoForm.js` and fill it out with the following:

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react'

class CreateTodoForm extends Component {
  constructor(){
    super()
    //sets the initial state via the constructor! that's the constructor's job :)
    this.state = {
      todo: ''
    }
  }
  onInputChange = (event) => {
    this.setState({
      todo: event.target.value
    })
  }
  onFormSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    let todo = this.state.todo
    this.props.createTodo(todo)
    this.setState({
      todo: ""
    })
  }
  render(){
    return (
      <div >
        <form onSubmit={ this.onFormSubmit } id="taskForm">
          <input  
            onChange={ this.onInputChange } 
            type="text" id="newItemDescription" 
            placeholder="What do you need to do?" 
            value={this.state.todo}
          />
          <button type="submit" id="addTask" className="btn">Add Todo</button>
        </form>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default CreateTodoForm
```

Whoa.. pauuuuseee. Let's take a look. First let's look at what we're rendering:

```js
render(){
  return (
    <div >
      <form onSubmit={ this.onFormSubmit } id="taskForm">
        <input  
          onChange={ this.onInputChange } 
          type="text" id="newItemDescription" 
          placeholder="What do you need to do?" 
          value={this.state.todo}
        />
        <button type="submit" id="addTask" className="btn">Add Todo</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  )
}
```

We define the initial state of the form in the constructor.

Looks like a form. When it gets submitted we run a function (we're using es6 arrow function here to pass an anonymous function with an event argument). That function is the `.onFormSubmit` function defined in this component.

> `onSubmit` is reserved JSX to define an event for form submission, almost identical to `ng-submit` in angular

Similarly when the `input` is changed we run `.onInputChange`.


Let's take a look at the `onInputChange` function first:

```js
onInputChange = (event) => {
  this.setState({
    todo: event.target.value
  })
}
```

Basically whenever this input changes, we're going to set the state of this component to have a property of `todo` and it's value is whatever the input field's value is.

`onFormSubmit`:

```js
onFormSubmit = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault()
  let todo = this.state.todo
  this.props.createTodo(todo)
  this.setState({
    todo: ""
  })
}
```

First off, prevent the default action as form submission will cause a request to fire. Then instantiate a variable todo from the state. Lastly we also set the todo property of the state as an empty string. We skipped one line though, `this.props.createTodo(todo)` What does that tell us about where `createTodo` comes from?

It needs to be supplied from its parent component. Let's update the `src/containers/TodosContainer.js` so that we can successfully create todos:

In `src/containers/TodosContainer.js`:  

```js
// At the top import the component
import CreateTodoForm from '../components/CreateTodoForm'

...

createTodo = (todo) => {
    let newTodo = {
        body: todo,
        completed: false
    }
    TodoModel.create(newTodo).then((res) => {
        let todos = this.state.todos
        let newTodos = todos.push(res.data)
        this.setState({newTodos})
    })
}
render(){
  return (
    <div className="todosComponent">
      <Todos
        todos={this.state.todos} />
      <CreateTodoForm
        createTodo={ this.createTodo }
        />
    </div>
  )
}
```

We see that we pass the `createTodo` function of THIS container component TO the `CreateTodoForm` component. Since we are using arrow functions instead of traditional function definitions we are not bound to a `this` inside our methods.  The `this` inside the methods actually refers to the context of the component. 

In the actual `createTodo` function. We can see that we construct everything we need about a todo in an object and store it in a variable. We then pass that object to a `.create` method on our `TodoModel` that ... hasn't been defined yet. Let's define it now. In `src/models/Todo.js`:

```js
static create(todo) {
  let request = axios.post(endPoint, todo)
  return request
}
```

Using axios, we create the `todo`. In the promise, we fetch all the `todos` and set the state to encapsulates those `todos` from the response.

## Backtrack - How did we pass state from child to parent?

Remember that in the submit event of the form, we used a function `this.props.createTodo()`:

In `src/components/CreateTodoForm`:

```js
onFormSubmit(event){
  event.preventDefault()
  let todo = this.state.todo
  this.props.createTodo(todo)
  this.setState({
    todo: ""
  })
}
```

We pass `createTodo` from the container as `props`. In `src/containers/TodosContainer.js`:

```js
constructor() {
  super(); 
}

render(){
  return (
    <div className="todosComponent">
      <CreateTodoForm
        createTodo={ this.createTodo }
        />
      <Todos
        todos={this.state.todos} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The argument passed in at the `CreateTodoForm` level(child) was state from that component. And now it updates state at the `TodosContainer` level(parent).

Sweet! Lets go to [Sprint 5: Deleting Todos](Sprint5.md)
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/react_todo_walkthrough/edit/master/sprints/Sprint4.md


## Sprint 6: Editing and Updating Todos

### Implementing Edit

To update a `todo` in our database we will need to initiate a pre-filled form that contains that specific data.  Once the user has updated the text in the form, they can click a button to initiate a save. The actual save button will trigger the database call to update.  

In `containers/TodosContainer.js`:

```js
  constructor() {
      super();
      this.state = {
          todos: []
      }
  }

  /* createTodo = ...  */

  /* deleteTodo = ...  */

  updateTodo = (todoBody, todoId) => {
    function isUpdatedTodo(todo) {
        return todo._id === todoId;
    }
    TodoModel.update(todoId, todoBody).then((res) => {
        let todos = this.state.todos
        todos.find(isUpdatedTodo).body = todoBody.body
        this.setState({todos: todos})
    })
  }

  render(){
    return (
      <div className="todosComponent">
        <CreateTodoForm
          createTodo={ this.createTodo }
        />
        <Todos
          todos={ this.state.todos }
          updateTodo={ this.updateTodo } 
          deleteTodo={ this.deleteTodo }
          />
      </div>
    )
  }
```

In the `components/Todos.js`, add `updateTodo` to `<Todo>` props:

```js
//....
 let todos = this.props.todos.map( (todo) => {
      return (
        <Todo
          key={todo._id}
          todo={todo}
          deleteTodo={this.props.deleteTodo}
          updateTodo={this.props.updateTodo} 
          />
      )
    })
//...
```

<!-- Todo changes -->
In `components/Todo.js` We need to add the method  `toggleBodyForm`:

```js
  toggleBodyForm = () => {
    (this.state.formStyle.display === 'block')?
      this.setState({formStyle: {display: 'none'}, bodyStyle: {display:'block'} })
    :
      this.setState({formStyle: {display:'block'}, bodyStyle: {display: 'none'}})
    
  }
```

This will hide the `todo` body and reveal the `todoForm` components.

Lets update our `Todo` render to have the `TodoForm` included. We'll also add an Edit link. When the user clicks on the edit link, the form will appear prepopulated with the text of the todo for easy altering. Neat!

```js
  render(){
    return(
      <li data-todos-index={this.props.todo.id}>
        <div style={this.state.bodyStyle}>
          <span >
            {this.props.todo.body}</span>
          <a
            className='edit' 
            onClick={this.toggleBodyForm}>
            Edit
          </a>
          <a
            className='remove' 
            onClick={this.deleteClickedTodo}>
            Remove
          </a>
        </div>
        <TodoForm 
          todo={this.props.todo}
          style={this.state.formStyle}
          autoFocus={true}
          buttonName="Update Todo!"
          updateTodo={this.props.updateTodo} 
          toggleBodyForm={this.toggleBodyForm} />
      </li> 
    )
  }
```

You will then have to both write the `TodoForm` component and then import it into `components/Todo.js`:

```js
//TodoForm.js
import React, {Component} from 'react'

class TodoForm extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  onChange = (event) => {
    this.setState({
      todo: event.target.value
    })
  }

  onSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    var todo = this.state.todo
    this.props.updateTodo(todo)
    this.setState({
      todo: ""
    })
  }

  render(){
    return (
      <div style={this.props.style} className='todoForm'>
        <form onSubmit={ this.onSubmit }>
          <input
            autoFocus={this.props.autoFocus}
            onChange={ this.onChange }
            placeholder='Write a todo here ...'
            type='text'
            value={(this.state && this.state.todo) || ''} />
          <button type='submit'>Save</button>
        </form>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default TodoForm

```

```js
//Todo.js
//...
{ this.props.editingTodoId === this.props.todo._id ? 
  <TodoForm
    autoFocus={true}
    onUpdateTodo={this.props.onUpdateTodo}
    buttonName="Update Todo!"/> : '' }
)
//...
```

```js
//Todos.js
let todos = this.props.todos.map( (todo) => {
  return (
    <Todo
      key={todo._id}
      todo={todo}
      deleteTodo={this.props.deleteTodo}
      updateTodo={this.props.updateTodo}
    />
  )
})
//...
```

In `models/Todo.js` add our method:

```js
  static update(todoId, updateInfo) {
    let request = axios.put(`${endPoint}/${todoId}`, updateInfo)
    return request
  }
```

Think back to what we did for the other CRUD actions--we define some axios behavior in `/models/Todo.js`. Then we define a method in `TodosContainer` that will handle update behavior.

Then we make our way down from `TodosContainer` to `Todos` to `Todo`, with `state` trickling down as `props`.

## Conclusion

We've learned how to do full CRUD for a basic todo app here. We've seen in particular how props can be trickled down through parent and child components to make a very modular app. We've also been introduced to the magic of axios for network calls from our frontend.

- naming in node express
While creating a new node project with npm init, be sure not to name the project (or the folder that the project lives inside of) the same as any of the node packages being used in the project itself.

For instance, you don't want to name the project "ejs" or "express", otherwise you'll end up with a "Refusing to install <package name> as a dependency of itself" error when you try to install said package using the 
> npm install --save <package name>  command.

If you come across this error then open the package.json file and rename the project on the first line: "name": "project-name-here", 

Project names need to be all lowercase and contain url friendly characters, e.g., no spaces, instead use a hyphen ("project-name-here").

- creating a express node project start up express node command express app start command **************************************
1) create a directory
> mkdir MyExpressProject
2) to into that folder MyEpxressProject
cd MyExpressProject
3) ls to check you don't see anything in there , pwd to see where you are you need to be on the MyExpressProejct folder
4) install the npm init to set up node modules
> npm init
  - utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
  during the package.json file walk thru
    1) name the project ejs-demo (project name can't be capitalized, no space uese hyphen -)
    2) entry point: app.js

  {
  "name": "ejs-demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}

5) create the app.js to write out your scripts and routes  
> touch app.js

6) install express and save it as dependency
> npm install express --save

7) basic express app set up inside of `app.js`
const express = require('express'); // require express I will use express
const app = express(); // all the function of express save it under 

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!')) // method .get() 2 parameters: ('/' << route, (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!') << call back fundtion ):  express documentation .receive(), .post()

app.listen(process.env.PORT, process.env.IP, function(){
    console.log("Server started");
});

- how to show nice html stuff on express:

1) move all the prettey htmll <h1> kind of things inside of views/home.ejs
  // express first look at views directory and looks for 
  //  whatever file you named there.

  // note: we use templating file .ejs since html file does'nt showup in express.
  > mkdir views // 
  > touch views/home.ejs
  > c9 views/home.ejs

2) you will see the error since you don't have ejs yet
> npm install ejs --save


const express = require('express'); // require express I will use express
const app = express(); // all the function of express save it under 

// express first look at views directory and looks for 
//  whatever file you named there.
app.get('/', (req, res) => res.render("home.ejs")); // method .get() 2 parameters: ('/' << route, (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!') << call back fundtion ):  express documentation .receive(), .post()


// we want to show that is dynamic variable route path param
// /fallinlovewith/pomsky
// => "you fell in love with pomsky"

### Base Challenges - Build an Express App

Solution in the solution branch.

**Check Install**

1. You should have Node.js and NPM installed from installfest. Run the Terminal commands `which node` and `which npm` to check that they are installed. If they are installed, you will see a file path after each command, like `/usr/local/bin/node`.

1. **Only if you do not have node and npm installed**:
  Install Node & NPM   

    1. To install Homebrew:

      ```bash
        ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
      ```

    2. To install Node.js: `brew install node`
    3. If you encounter issues, ask for help!

**Initialize a Node.js Project with Express**

1. Go to your `~/wdi` directory and clone this repo.  (You don't need to fork.)  From inside your `express-intro` directory, enter the Terminal command `npm init`. It asks a series of questions about your project and uses the information to create a `package.json` file for you. For now, we'll use all of the defaults except "entry point". **Type in `server.js` for your entry point**, and then you can just hit enter until `npm init` is done.  Take a look at `package.json` to see the initial information `npm init` helps you set up.

2. Add express to the local project using `npm`. Use the `save` option so that NPM automatically adds express to your dependencies in `package.json`.

  ```bash
  npm install express 
  ```

  Notice that a new folder called `node_modules` was created. Open it up and you'll see that there is an `express` folder. `node_modules` is where the dependencies in `package.json` are downloaded to.  If you look at `package.json` again, you'll see express has been added as a dependency for this project.

**Express Hello World!**

1. Create a `server.js` file and add this basic hello world code:

  ```js
    // server.js
    // SERVER-SIDE JAVASCRIPT
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();

    // Allow CORS: we'll use this today to reduce security so we can more easily test our code in the browser.
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
      res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
      res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
      next();
    });

    app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'));

    app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000,  () => console.log('Example app listening at http://localhost:3000/'));
  ```
2. Add a comment above each line of code saying what each line does.

  > **Hint**: Reference [the express documentation](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app).
  > **Hint**: `process.env.PORT || 3000` means "in production use the production port, otherwise use 3000 (for development)".

3. Run `node server.js` in the Terminal. You should see 'Example app listening at http://localhost:3000/' _in the Terminal_.  When we're using express, this is where our server-side console logs show up!  Also, visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser. You should see "Hello World!"  The browser console only shows client-side console outputs. **Every time you make a change in your server code and want it to run, you need to end the previous server and run `node server.js`**.

4. Console log the `req` (request) and the `res` (response) objects inside your server code's `app.get` method for the `/` path. (The `/` path is often called the "root" path.) Restart the server and briefly check out what the `req` and `res` are.


**Add Some Data on the Server**

1. In server.js, add some starter data  (often called "seed data") to serve when the users visit '/api/albums'.

  ```js
    // server.js
    const albums = [
      {
        title: 'Cupid Deluxe',
        artist: 'Blood Orange'
      },
      {
        title: 'M3LL155X - EP',
        artist: 'FKA twigs'
      },
      {
        title: 'Fake History',
        artist: 'letlive.'
      }
    ];
  ```

2.  To have this data be accessible, we'll need to set up a route to serve it. Add an `app.get` method for the path `/api/albums`.  Inside the new route, use `res.json(albums)` to respond with some JSON containing all the albums from our albums variable.

  > Restart your server, and you should see our albums when you use postman to request the `http://localhost:3000/api/albums` URL.  You could also try using curl: `curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/albums` or just your browser.

**Request Data From the Server**

1. Let's get this working with our index page now.  In your browser, open `index.html` and then open the javascript console.  You should see 'Sanity Check: JS is working!'  Try running the following AJAX request in the JavaScript console:

  ```js
  
  const handleSuccess = json =>  console.log(json);

  const handleError = (xhr, status, errorThrown) => console.log('uh oh');

  
  $.ajax({
     method: 'GET',
     url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/albums',
     success: handleSuccess,
     error: handleError
   });


  ```
  > Note: you must be on a page with jQuery in order to use .ajax in the browser console!  Fortunately, the included index.js does have jQuery.

  You should get something back like:
  ```
  [Object, Object, Object]
  ```
  Dig into those and see what they look like.

2. Next edit `app.js` to run the same ajax call as above and console log the data.  Remember to put your ajax call inside the handler for the document ready event: `$(document).ready(function() {})`. Consider moving the success handling function definition outside the ajax call, since it's about to get more complicated!

3. Once you have that, edit `app.js` to display this data on your `index.html` page using jQuery.  Decide how you want it to look.  **Hint:** You might also find it useful to edit `index.html`!

4. Restart your server and refresh the page. You should see a list of album titles on the page.

**Serve our index page**

At this point, `server.js` and our client-side files (`index.html`, `app.js`, and `styles.css`) are only connected by the ajax request made in `app.js`. Let's make a route to serve our `index.html`.  We're just going to serve the index on the route GET `/` for now.

1. First let's be sure we follow a good convention for file location and directory structure. This will help a lot when organizing larger projects.  Move `index.html` into a new `views` directory. (Create the directory first.)

  _A good express file tree structure_:

  ```
  ├── server.js  // your server code
  ├── package.json    // project info and dependencies; changed by npm init or npm install somePackage
  ├── public  // i.e. client-side
  │   ├── images  // images to serve to client
  │   ├── scripts  // or js
  │       └── app.js   // client-side javascript file
  │   └── styles // or css
  │       └── styles.css
  ├── vendor // an optional 2nd public directory that includes jQuery & bootstrap if we choose not to use a CDN
  └── views  // html files that we'll serve
  │   ├── index.html
  ```

2. We're just going to serve our index on the root route, `/`, so change the current GET `/` route from serving the string `'hello world'` to instead sending the `index.html` file, with `res.sendFile('views/index.html' , { root : __dirname});`. Curious about what this does? Try logging `__dirname` to your console.

  > If you restart your server now and visit 'localhost:3000' in the browser, you'll notice the site now shows the contents of the html file instead of just the hello world message! Congratulations; you now have a server serving a page!

  > But the page looks a little different than when we just opened it as a file, and you'll see some errors in the console.  That's because we're not yet serving the js and css files the page needs.  Let's fix that next.

**Add Static Files (CSS, JS, Images)**

1. Make a directory in your project called `public`; then create `public/scripts`, `public/styles` and `public/images` subdirectories.  Move `styles.css`, and `app.js`, into their public subdirectories.  These files are called static files. (You can delete the old directories they were in.)

2. Set up the express app to serve the static files (actually, the whole public directory.)

  ```js
    // server.js
    app.use(express.static('public'));
  ```

3. Get a `console.log("Sanity Check: JS is working!")` from your `app.js` to appear in your browser dev tools console.

4. Get the css styles in `styles.css` working again on the index page.

5. Everything should be working again now, and you should see your albums when you visit `localhost:3000`.  If not, fix it!

**Challenge**

We're making a weird app. Albums and taquerias.  Treat your senses.  

1. Add some taqueria seed data to your server file.

  ```js
    // server.js
    const taquerias = [
      { name: "La Taqueria" },
      { name: "El Farolito" },
      { name: "Taqueria Cancun" }
    ];
  ```

2. Add a route to your server side javascript that clients can use to get taqueria data.  The route's path should be `/api/taquerias`.  Instead of `res.send` (for simple strings) or `res.sendFile`, this route will use `res.json`.


  ```js
    app.get('/api/taquerias', (req, res) => res.json(taquerias));
  ```

3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/api/taquerias (remember to restart your server first!) and check that the data is showing up.


4. In your `app.js` file, write a jQuery AJAX request to get the taqueria data. When the response comes back, display all the taqueria names above the albums on your site's root page (localhost:3000/).  

  <details><summary> Want a reminder of the ajax call structure? Click here!</summary>

  ```js
  $.ajax({
    method: 'GET',
    url: '/api/taquerias',
    success: handleResponse
  });

  const handleResponse = (json) => {
    // your code here
  }
  ```

  </details>

### Stretch Challenges

1. Add a `vendor` folder to your project. The `vendor` folder is traditionally used for third-party (external) library code.  Download Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript files and add them to the `vendor` folder. Can you include Bootstrap in your project from this location instead of the CDN? What is the benefit of having a separate `vendor` folder for external front-end libraries?

  > **Hint**: Remember to serve the static vendor files to make them available to your front end.

  ```js
    // server.js
    app.use(express.static('vendor'));
  ```

2. Add an image to your `public/images` folder and display it in `index.html`.

# Node.js and Express

### Why is this important?
<!-- framing the "why" in big-picture/real world examples -->
*This workshop is important because:*

These are the first tools we'll use to write server-side code. In order to be a **full-stack** web developer, you'll need to have a grasp on writing code on the backend. Node and Express are the industry standard technologies for writing server-side JavaScript. If you find yourself working in an environment that uses a full JS stack, you will be using Node.js and Express. Node is a lightweight and efficient runtime for building JavaScript servers. Express is a very popular and trending framework with a bevy of modules you can add to it.

### What are the objectives?
<!-- specific/measurable goal for students to achieve -->
*After this workshop, developers will be able to:*

- describe the roles that Node.js and Express play in building a server.
- draw a diagram of the request response cycle with Node.js and Express included and labeled.
- use `npm` to initialize a node project and write a local web server to serve JSON and static assets with Express.


### Where should we be now?
<!-- call out the skills that are prerequisites -->
*Before this workshop, developers should already be able to:*

- draw a figure of the request-response cycle with the details filled in on the front end (user, event listeners, AJAX, success callbacks, and HTTP verbs).
- make an AJAX request to a third party API and explore the JSON data it returns.

## What is a server?

<details>
  <summary>Take 5 minutes to search the web to pull together a working definition of what a "server" is and what it does.</summary>
  <h5>Meta question: how did you go about searching? </h5>
</details>

## What does it mean to program a server?

We need to write the code that handles requests and figures out how to respond. It might need to format data into JSON, it might need to talk to a database to request a specific resource, and it might need to check if a user is authorized to see the resource they have requested.

To write server side code, is to lay out all of the possible requests that might come in and give instructions for how to handle each type of request.

### What is Node?

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6520345/18023104/d38c2168-6ba9-11e6-997c-24b3a2652991.png)

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6520345/18023096/c368ce26-6ba9-11e6-805a-4562a8853721.png)

V8, the JavaScript engine that runs Chrome, is a piece of code written in C++. It creates a processor to take in JS code and translate it to make actionable assembly code/machine code so that the CPU can “do” what you have asked it to in JavaScript. Node is a program that has all of the V8 code and more. It extends V8; V8 is embedded in NodeJS, and Node adds more functionality and syntax that V8 wouldn’t be able to understand. This syntax allows you to write server-side code. (V8 is created to meet the EcmaScript 6 - the standard that defines JavaScript).

- Node.js provides the ability to handle requests and issue responses.
- It is fast.
- It is fast largely because it is asynchronous, meaning code can run in parallel without "blocking" the call stack (the list of other concurrent commands).
- Node really shines when it comes to heavy input-output type operations.
- Realtime services like chat applications or conferencing platforms benefit from using Node.
- APIs are also input/output heavy, and they also tend to work with JavaScript out of the box (think JSON). What better platform than Node?
- Node is designed to accommodate [the module pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript), which means that it allows developers to write useful functionality and then share it with other developers. It is easy to pull in useful modules into your project (like express). This keeps functionality separate and helps projects feel organized.

### NPM and NPM Init
- Node Package Manager, usually called NPM, is a tool that allows us to easily download community-built Node packages.
  * For example, instead of using a CDN to download bootstrap and make sure your version is up-to-date, you can install it with NPM, which will help you manage the downloads and versions.
- Initialize new Node project with NPM: `npm init`. This will simply create one file, `package.json`.
- NPM works with `package.json`, a file in your project, which is a list of project information. NPM makes sure that packages do not get uploaded or tracked in git (imagine how much unnecessary code you could be pushing and pulling each time). To make sure all collaborators are still on the same page, any package listed in `package.json` can easily be downloaded with one command, `npm install`, when somebody clones your project.
- To install NPM packages *and* save them to `package.json`, use the `--save specification`: `npm install --save express` or `npm install --save bootstrap`.



### Express JS
Express is a cutting-edge, unopinionated, server-side JavaScript framework that runs on a Node.js server. It is a popular framework with a bevy of modules you can add to it. Node is the platform and Express provides the specific functionality. If you were building a house rather than a server, Node would be the foundation and utilities, express would be the building material that comprises the above ground building.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6520345/18060592/f5954682-6dd3-11e6-99ba-5dc0b42a4ff8.png)




- Express is a framework built on top of Node.js that makes development of web servers more intuitive and quicker.
- Express allows us to easily set up routes that will trigger actions such as rendering pages or returning JSON.

Much like jQuery does for JavaScript, Express provides easy, intuitive syntax and a lot of built in functionality.

### Hello World in Express

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'))

const server = app.listen(3000);
```




### Express file tree

With frontend and backend code to organize, we should make sure to keep our files in a logical order.

```
├── server.js  // your server code
├── package.json    // lists dependencies; changed by npm install --save somePackage
├── public  // i.e. client-side
│   ├── images  // images to serve to client
│   ├── scripts
│       └── app.js   // client-side javascript file
│   └── styles
│       └── style.css
├── vendor // optional 2nd public dir for jQuery & bootstrap if we choose not to use CDNs
├── views  // html files that we'll serve
│   └── index.html
└── node_modules  // don't edit files in here!
    ├── express // etc
```

> We should also add `node_modules` to a `.gitignore` file so it is not checked into git.  Future developers can just run `npm install` to get the packages listed in `package.json`

**In Express**

Let's look at a basic `get` method in an express app.

```js
// server.js
  let taquerias = [
    { name: "La Taqueria" },
    { name: "El Farolito" },
    { name: "Taqueria Cancun" }
  ]
```

```js
  app.get('/api/taquerias', (req, res) => res.json(taquerias) );
```

Note that the `app` object has a method called `.get()` which takes two arguments: a url and a callback function. The callback takes two arguments: `req` and `res`. These stand for "Request" and "Response" from the request response cycle. We'll be console logging these objects in the exercises.

### Game Plan

Today's [exercises](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-46/express-intro-lab) are set up a bit like a tutorial to walk you through:

  * creating a new project with Node and Express
  * creating routes for clients to make requests to your server
  * storing data on the server
  * responding to GET requests with simple strings (`res.send`), or JSON data (`res.json`)
  * serving static files (images, css...)



## Closing Thoughts
- This afternoon we're going to learn more about the details of routes and resource serving in Express apps.
- Check your own understanding: Do you know the differences between Node's role and Express's role? What do each of them do?
- You'll be using this technology for the next several weeks!

Solution in the solution branch.

**Check Install**

1. You should have Node.js and NPM installed from installfest. Run the Terminal commands `which node` and `which npm` to check that they are installed. If they are installed, you will see a file path after each command, like `/usr/local/bin/node`.

1. **Only if you do not have node and npm installed**:
  Install Node & NPM   

    1. To install Homebrew:

      ```bash
        ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
      ```

    2. To install Node.js: `brew install node`
    3. If you encounter issues, ask for help!

**Initialize a Node.js Project with Express**

1. Go to your `~/wdi` directory and clone this repo.  (You don't need to fork.)  From inside your `express-intro` directory, enter the Terminal command `npm init`. It asks a series of questions about your project and uses the information to create a `package.json` file for you. For now, we'll use all of the defaults except "entry point". **Type in `server.js` for your entry point**, and then you can just hit enter until `npm init` is done.  Take a look at `package.json` to see the initial information `npm init` helps you set up.

2. Add express to the local project using `npm`. Use the `save` option so that NPM automatically adds express to your dependencies in `package.json`.

  ```bash
  npm install express --save
  ```

  Notice that a new folder called `node_modules` was created. Open it up and you'll see that there is an `express` folder. `node_modules` is where the dependencies in `package.json` are downloaded to.  If you look at `package.json` again, you'll see express has been added as a dependency for this project.

**Express Hello World!**

1. Create a `server.js` file and add this basic hello world code:

  ```js
    // server.js
    // SERVER-SIDE JAVASCRIPT
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();

    // Allow CORS: we'll use this today to reduce security so we can more easily test our code in the browser.
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
      res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
      res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
      next();
    });

    app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'));

    app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000,  () => console.log('Example app listening at http://localhost:3000/'));
  ```
2. Add a comment above each line of code saying what each line does.

  > **Hint**: Reference [the express documentation](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app).
  > **Hint**: `process.env.PORT || 3000` means "in production use the production port, otherwise use 3000 (for development)".

3. Run `node server.js` in the Terminal. You should see 'Example app listening at http://localhost:3000/' _in the Terminal_.  When we're using express, this is where our server-side console logs show up!  Also, visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser. You should see "Hello World!"  The browser console only shows client-side console outputs. **Every time you make a change in your server code and want it to run, you need to end the previous server and run `node server.js`**.

4. Console log the `req` (request) and the `res` (response) objects inside your server code's `app.get` method for the `/` path. (The `/` path is often called the "root" path.) Restart the server and briefly check out what the `req` and `res` are.


**Add Some Data on the Server**

1. In server.js, add some starter data  (often called "seed data") to serve when the users visit '/api/albums'.

  ```js
    // server.js
    const albums = [
      {
        title: 'Cupid Deluxe',
        artist: 'Blood Orange'
      },
      {
        title: 'M3LL155X - EP',
        artist: 'FKA twigs'
      },
      {
        title: 'Fake History',
        artist: 'letlive.'
      }
    ];
  ```

2.  To have this data be accessible, we'll need to set up a route to serve it. Add an `app.get` method for the path `/api/albums`.  Inside the new route, use `res.json(albums)` to respond with some JSON containing all the albums from our albums variable.

  > Restart your server, and you should see our albums when you use postman to request the `http://localhost:3000/api/albums` URL.  You could also try using curl: `curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/albums` or just your browser.

**Request Data From the Server**

1. Let's get this working with our index page now.  In your browser, open `index.html` and then open the javascript console.  You should see 'Sanity Check: JS is working!'  Try running the following AJAX request in the JavaScript console:

  ```js
  $.ajax({
     method: 'GET',
     url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/albums',
     success: handleSuccess,
     error: handleError
   });

   const handleSuccess = json =>  console.log(json);

   const handleError = (xhr, status, errorThrown) => console.log('uh oh');

  ```
  > Note: you must be on a page with jQuery in order to use .ajax in the browser console!  Fortunately, the included index.js does have jQuery.

  You should get something back like:
  ```
  [Object, Object, Object]
  ```
  Dig into those and see what they look like.

2. Next edit `app.js` to run the same ajax call as above and console log the data.  Remember to put your ajax call inside the handler for the document ready event: `$(document).ready(function() {})`. Consider moving the success handling function definition outside the ajax call, since it's about to get more complicated!

3. Once you have that, edit `app.js` to display this data on your `index.html` page using jQuery.  Decide how you want it to look.  **Hint:** You might also find it useful to edit `index.html`!

4. Restart your server and refresh the page. You should see a list of album titles on the page.

**Serve our index page**

At this point, `server.js` and our client-side files (`index.html`, `app.js`, and `styles.css`) are only connected by the ajax request made in `app.js`. Let's make a route to serve our `index.html`.  We're just going to serve the index on the route GET `/` for now.

1. First let's be sure we follow a good convention for file location and directory structure. This will help a lot when organizing larger projects.  Move `index.html` into a new `views` directory. (Create the directory first.)

  _A good express file tree structure_:

  ```
  ├── server.js  // your server code
  ├── package.json    // project info and dependencies; changed by npm init or npm install --save somePackage
  ├── public  // i.e. client-side
  │   ├── images  // images to serve to client
  │   ├── scripts  // or js
  │       └── app.js   // client-side javascript file
  │   └── styles // or css
  │       └── styles.css
  ├── vendor // an optional 2nd public directory that includes jQuery & bootstrap if we choose not to use a CDN
  └── views  // html files that we'll serve
  │   ├── index.html
  ```

2. We're just going to serve our index on the root route, `/`, so change the current GET `/` route from serving the string `'hello world'` to instead sending the `index.html` file, with `res.sendFile('views/index.html' , { root : __dirname});`. Curious about what this does? Try logging `__dirname` to your console.

  > If you restart your server now and visit 'localhost:3000' in the browser, you'll notice the site now shows the contents of the html file instead of just the hello world message! Congratulations; you now have a server serving a page!

  > But the page looks a little different than when we just opened it as a file, and you'll see some errors in the console.  That's because we're not yet serving the js and css files the page needs.  Let's fix that next.

```js
    // server.js
    // SERVER-SIDE JAVASCRIPT
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();

    // Allow CORS: we'll use this today to reduce security so we can more easily test our code in the browser.
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
      res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
      res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
      next();
    });

  // server serving a page! route to serve our `index.html`. serve the index on the route GET `/` for now.
    app.get('/', (req, res) => res.sendFile('views/index.html' , { root : __dirname}));

    app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000,  () => console.log('Example app listening at http://localhost:3000/'));
```    
server static file in express:
```js
// SERVER-SIDE JAVASCRIPT
var express = require('express');
// set reference var app from an instance of express
var app = express();


// Allow CORS: we'll use this today to reduce security so we can more easily test our code in the browser.
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
  next();
});

// server serving a page! route to serve our `index.html`. serve the index on the route GET `/` for now.
// app.get('/', (req, res) => res.sendFile('views/index.html' , { root : __dirname}));
// MIDDLEWARE
// app.use(express.static('public'));
// pass in the entire parent directory path as  __dirname
app.use(express.static('__dirname'));
// server serving a page! route to serve our `index.html`. serve the index on the route GET `/` for now.
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // console.log("__dirname: ", __dirname);
  res.sendFile('index.html' , { root : __dirname});
});

// dynamically display which app is displaying by setting var server 
//  to app.listen and pass in second parameter server.address().port
//  see the real port that the app is being served
var server = app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000,  () => console.log('Example app listening at http://localhost:3000/', server.address().port));
var server = app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000,  () => console.log('Example app listening on port localhost: ', server.address().port));
```  

**Add Static Files (CSS, JS, Images)**

1. Make a directory in your project called `public`; then create `public/scripts`, `public/styles` and `public/images` subdirectories.  Move `styles.css`, and `app.js`, into their public subdirectories.  These files are called static files. (You can delete the old directories they were in.)

2. Set up the express app to serve the static files (actually, the whole public directory.)

  ```js
    // server.js
    app.use(express.static('public'));
  ```

3. Get a `console.log("Sanity Check: JS is working!")` from your `app.js` to appear in your browser dev tools console.

4. Get the css styles in `styles.css` working again on the index page.

5. Everything should be working again now, and you should see your albums when you visit `localhost:3000`.  If not, fix it!

**Challenge**

We're making a weird app. Albums and taquerias.  Treat your senses.  

1. Add some taqueria seed data to your server file.

  ```js
    // server.js
    const taquerias = [
      { name: "La Taqueria" },
      { name: "El Farolito" },
      { name: "Taqueria Cancun" }
    ];
  ```

2. Add a route to your server side javascript that clients can use to get taqueria data.  The route's path should be `/api/taquerias`.  Instead of `res.send` (for simple strings) or `res.sendFile`, this route will use `res.json`.


  ```js
    app.get('/api/taquerias', (req, res) => res.json(taquerias));
  ```

3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/api/taquerias (remember to restart your server first!) and check that the data is showing up.


4. In your `app.js` file, write a jQuery AJAX request to get the taqueria data. When the response comes back, display all the taqueria names above the albums on your site's root page (localhost:3000/).  

  <details><summary> Want a reminder of the ajax call structure? Click here!</summary>

  ```js
  $.ajax({
    method: 'GET',
    url: '/api/taquerias',
    success: handleResponse
  });

  const handleResponse = (json) => {
    // your code here
  }
  ```

  </details>

### Stretch Challenges

1. Add a `vendor` folder to your project. The `vendor` folder is traditionally used for third-party (external) library code.  Download Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript files and add them to the `vendor` folder. Can you include Bootstrap in your project from this location instead of the CDN? What is the benefit of having a separate `vendor` folder for external front-end libraries?

  > **Hint**: Remember to serve the static vendor files to make them available to your front end.

  ```js
    // server.js
    app.use(express.static('vendor'));
  ```
2. Add an image to your `public/images` folder and display it in `index.html`.

- what is process.env.PORT mean?

// set up port 3000 to listen
//  process.env.PORT || 3000 "in production use the production port, otherwise use 3000 (for development)".
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000,  () => console.log('Server is up and running!!! Example app listening at http://localhost:3000/'));

- .gitignore file 
> touch .gitignore
// inside .gitignore file so node_modules don't get d/l when other developers try to use your app
**/node_modules

- to make ul
```javascript
var outputHTML = '<ul>';
undefined
outputHTML
"<ul>"
outputHTML += '</ul>'
"<ul></ul>"
```

## Initial Setup create-react-app

In order to create a new project and to get our development environment setup, we are going to use the Terminal command `create-react-app`. It will create a new folder in your current directory for the in-class application.

`create-react-app` is an NPM package also built by Facebook that writes our build dependencies for us so that we can do less configuration. It allows us to use React, JSX, and ES6. It also allows us to import our CSS, it autoprefixes our CSS so that we don't have to worry about cross browser compatibility, it gives us a dev server to run, and it enables hot reloading which updates the code in our browser without us refreshing the page.

It uses Webpack which is a build tool that enables many of the features listed above. It also includes Babel which transpiles our JavaScript from ES6 to be compatible with older browsers. It also includes Autoprefixer for CSS compatibility, ESLint for linting, and Jest for testing.

You can also set up all this yourself, but for now `create-react-app` allows us to worry more about our code and less about configuration.

```bash
$ npm i -g create-react-app // updating this script to get the latest version of this create-react-app
$ create-react-app blog-app // creating a react app name folder blog-app
$ cd blog-app
$ code .
$ npm start
```

> Here you will begin setting up a blog app that you will continue working on during this lesson's exercises. For demonstration purposes, We will be creating a simple "hello world" app.

After running `$ npm start`, we can view the app at `http://localhost:3000`

`create-react-app` provides us with all the necessary tools and configuration necessary to start writing React. `npm start` refers to an included script that starts up the development server.

Along with installing the necessary dependencies, it creates an initial app skeleton that looks like this...

```bash
├──README.md
├──  favicon.ico
├──  index.html
├──  node_modules
├──  package.json
└──  src
    ├──  App.css
    ├──  App.js
    ├──  index.css
    ├──  index.js
    └──  logo.svg
```

Most of the important files, which are primarily the ones where we will be working today, are in the `/src` directory.

Take some time and look at what's been generated. Specifically look in `App.js` and `index.js`

### API: 
- making request api from terminal request webpage from terminal use curl
> curl http://www.google.com
- making request to api from Javascript file
> https://github.com/request/request

- server response code:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes
  - 200 OK
  - 404 page not found

Here is how you make request to server using request npm:
<!-- first-request.js) -->
var request = require('request');
request('http://www.google.com', function(error, response, body) {
    if(!error && response.statusCode === 200) {
        console.log(body); // Show HTML for the Google Homepge
    }
})

<!-- above is same as below -->
var request = require('request');
// request( 'url' => will make request but to do anything we need a cb.
//  why cb?request => response takes time to get the data for us.  
request('https://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20astronomy.sunset%20from%20weather.forecast%20where%20woeid%20in%20(select%20woeid%20from%20geo.places(1)%20where%20text%3D%22maui%2C%20hi%22)&format=json&env=store%3A%2F%2Fdatatables.org%2Falltableswithkeys', function(error, response, body){
    if(error){
        console.log("SOMETHING WENT WRONG!!");
        console.log(error);
    } else {
        if(response.statusCode === 200){
            // Things worked!!
            console.log(body);
        }
        
    }
});

var request = require('request');
// request( 'url' => will make request but to do anything we need a cb.
//  why cb?request => response takes time to get the data for us.  
request('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1', function(error, response, body){
    if(!error && response.statusCode === 200){
            console.log(body);
    }
});

using js

just to to url and enter the 
  > https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1 => you will see json inside your brwoser too!!

- turn string into js obj
var request = require('request');
// request( 'url' => will make request but to do anything we need a cb.
//  why cb?request => response takes time to get the data for us.  
request('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1', function(error, response, body){
    if(!error && response.statusCode === 200){
        // turns string body into javascript obj JSON.parse(body)
        var parsedData = JSON.parse(body);
        console.log(parsedData.userId);
    }
});

- try with users api
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

- locus to see response error info
request('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1', function(error, response, body){
    eval(require('locus'));
    if(!error && response.statusCode === 200){
        // turns string body into javascript obj JSON.parse(body)
        var parsedData = JSON.parse(body);
        console.log(parsedData);
    }

# Express Routes & Parameters

### Why is this important?
<!-- framing the "why" in big-picture/real world examples -->
*This workshop is important because:*

Hard-coded routes like `/about`, `/home`, and `/contact` will only take a website so far.  Two great strategies save us from hard-coding every valid URL for a site. Parameterized routes like `/users/:name` help give a website the flexibility to grow as data is added.  A route that can handle query strings can read in extra data sent by the client, like `/search?q=epiphany`, and respond appropriately.  These strategies will also help keep code DRY.

### What are the objectives?
<!-- specific/measurable goal for students to achieve -->
*After this workshop, developers will be able to:*

- Create more flexible, dynamic routes with parameterized route urls.
- Process data sent to a server through query strings.
- Process data sent from named form fields with `POST` requests.
- Identify Express routing patterns that can be used for PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests.


### Where should we be now?
<!-- call out the skills that are prerequisites -->
*Before this workshop, developers should already be able to:*

- Describe or draw how a server and a client participate in the request/response cycle with AJAX.
- Create simple, hard-coded routes in the Express framework.
- Distinguish between JavaScript, Node.js, npm, and Express.


### Review: Creating an App

#### 1. Directory and File Setup

Let's start a simple **Express** application.

1. Make a project directory and `server.js`:

  ```bash
  mkdir express_example
  cd express_example
  touch server.js
  ```

2. Use `npm init` to create a `package.json`:

  ```bash
  npm init
  ```

3. Install Express and open the project directory in your text editor:

  ```bash
  npm install express

  code .

  # or use:
  subl .
  ```

  The folder structure will be:

  ```
  express_example
    ├── node_modules/
        └── express/
    ├── server.js  
    ├── package.json
    ...
  ```


##### Check for Understanding

<details><summary>Summarize the effects of the two npm commands above.</summary>

* Node Package Manager keeps track of the various libraries and third-party packages of code used in a Node project.  

* The `npm init` command helps you set up `package.json`, which stores important information about the project.  

* `npm install  express` tells the Node Package Manager to download and install the Express library for this particular project.  The `install` command lets NPM know that we will be downloading and using `express` for this project and to save it into the project's `package.json`.  

The above two `npm` commands will be necessary for every new web application that uses Express.  Other packages can also be installed as above.

</details>


#### 2. Server Setup

1. Write some boilerplate code for a simple server.  Remember to require express, call the `express` function to create a server, and tell the server to  start listening.

  `server.js`
  ```js
  // REQUIREMENTS
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();

  // MIDDLEWARE
  app.use(express.static('public'));

  // ROUTES
  // ... coming soon

  // SERVER START
  app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("HTTP server listening at localhost:3000");
  });

  ```

2. Start the server:

  ```bash
  node server.js
  ```

##### Check for Understanding

<details><summary>Visit localhost:3000/ in your browser. Why don't we see anything yet? How can we show something here?</summary>

There aren't any routes yet! Add the following to the routes section of your `server.js` file and visit `localhost:3000/` again:

```js
app.get("/", (request, response) => {
  // send back the response: 'Hello World'
  response.send('Hello World');
});
```
</details>


#### 3. Starter Routes

##### Routes Review

Building an application requires a firm grasp of something  **routing**.  Each **route** is a combination of a **Request Type** and **Path**.  Code for the server lets us dictate how it will respond to requests on each route.


##### More Hard-Coded Routes

Let's build two more routes into our application:

| Request Type | Request Path | Response
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/` | `Hello World` |
| `GET` | `/api/burgers` | `Hamburger`, `Cheese Burger`, `Vegetable Burger` |
| `GET` | `/api/tacos` | `Soft Taco`, `Crunchy Taco`, `Super Taco` |


<details><summary> click to see contents of `server.js`</summary>

```js
// REQUIREMENTS
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

//DATA (temporary until we know how to use databases)
const burgers = [
  'Hamburger',
  'Cheese Burger',
  'Vegetable Burger'
];

var tacos = [
  'Soft Taco',
  'Crunchy Taco',
  'Super Taco'
];


// MIDDLEWARE
app.use(express.static('public'));


// ROUTES
app.get("/", (request, response) => {
  response.send("Hello World");
});

app.get("/api/burgers",  (request, response) => {
  //send all the burgers     
  response.json(burgers);
});

app.get("/api/tacos",  (request, response) => {
  //send all the tacos       
  response.json(tacos);
});

// SERVER START
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("HTTP server listening at localhost:3000");
});

```
</details>

### Parameterized URLs

What if we want to create an app that can dynamically say hello to anyone?

**URL parameters** let us add dynamic routes to the application. In Express, parameters in a URL are indicated by a colon `:` and any variable name you want to use. We'll use `:name` for the example below.

```js
app.get("/greetings/:name", (request, response) => {
  response.send( "Hello, " + request.params.name );
});
```

In the route above, `:name` is considered a route or URL parameter. Inside the route's callback, the parameter is accessible with `request.params.name`.

| Request Type | Request Path | Response
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/greetings/:name` | `Hello, :name` |

<details><summary>What URL would you visit to see the results of the route above? Can you make the site say hello with your name?</summary>

Reset your server and go to [http://localhost:3000/greetings/jane](http://localhost:3000/greetings/jane), but use your name instead if it's not Jane!

</details>

### Independent Practice: Pick A Color

Create a route that responds with "You picked: blue" or "You picked: green" depending on a parameter in its path. For instance, if I visit `localhost:3000/pick-a-color/orange` in the browser, I should see the name of the color I chose (orange) as the response.

<details><summary>click for answer</summary>

```js
// server.js
// Pick A Color Route
app.get('/color/:choice', (request, response) => {
  let choice = request.params.choice;
  response.send('Your color is: ' + choice);
});
```

</details>


### Query String Parameters

When you want even more flexibility, **query string parameters** can be included with each request.

<img src="https://i.giphy.com/uHEqSttWHv476.gif">

Let's see query params in action. Go to [https://google.com/search?q=kittens&tbm=isch](https://google.com/search?q=kittens&tbm=isch).

#### Query String Review

* `?` marks the beginning of the query parameters.
* `=` indicates a key-value-pair assignment; the text to the left is a key, while the right is its value.
* `&` allows for multiple parameters; it separates the key-value pairs.



#### Query Parameters in Express

In Express, query string parameters are available in the `request.query` object. Let's add our first route to practice query params.

```js
app.get("/thank", (request, response) => {
  console.log(request.query);
  let name = request.query.name;
  response.send('Thank you, ' + name + '!');
});
```

#### Check for Understanding

<details><summary>What URL would you visit to see the results of the route above? Can you make the site say thank you with your name?</summary>

Reset your server and go to [localhost:3000/thank?name=jane](localhost:3000/thank?name=jane), but use your name instead if it's not Jane!

</details>


### Independent Practice: Calculator App

1. Create a `/multiply` route that uses query parameters `x` and `y` to multiple two numbers and send the result back: `"10 is the result"`.


  <details><summary>click for answer</summary>

  ```js
  // server.js
  // Calculator
  app.get('/multiply', (request, response) => {
    let x = request.query.x;
    let y = request.query.y;
    let total = parseInt(x)*parseInt(y);
    response.send( `${total} is the result`);
  });
  ```

  </details>


2.  Create an `/add` route, similar to above.


  <details><summary>click for answer</summary>

  ```js
  // server.js
  // Calculator
app.get('/add', (request, response) => {
  let x = request.query.x;
  let y = request.query.y;
  let total = parseInt(x) +parseInt(y);
  response.send( `${total} is the result`);
});
  ```

  </details>

### Choosing Parameter Types

* **request url parameters:** `http://localhost:3000/icecream/:flavor`

* **query string parameters:** `http://localhost:3000/icecream?flavor=SOMEFLAVOR`

Generally, if the parameter is identifying an individual _entity_ or _resource_, you most likely want request/url parameters.  If it is an optional parameter for a route, you should use query string parameters.

Common cases for **Request URL Parameters**:
* **database/item IDs**            -  GET `/contacts/348`
* **major components of the app**  -  GET `/users/2a98cef`
* **expressing hierarchies**       -  GET `/departments/44/employees/2`

> Request params are not always nonsense IDs. Names can be used in some systems: `/departments/physics/employees/LutherRichard`

Common cases for **Query Parameters**:
* **searches**             -  GET `/?q=kittens`
* **optional selections**  -  GET `/calculator?lang=en`
* **pagination**           -  GET `/articles?start=1&num=10`
* **other limits**         -  GET `/posts?since=2015-11-29`

Of course, you might combine both in some cases: `/posts/33/comments?limit=50`

### Independent Practice: Which Taco?


<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/EsDCYBUQM0KlO/giphy.gif">

1. Hardcode some data in your main server file. This will stand in for database data until we learn how to connect a database.

  ``` javascript
  const tacos = [
                  "Soft Taco",
                  "Crunchy Taco",
                  "Super Taco"
              ];
  ```

2. We'd like a route that will allow you to access a single taco by its index in the array. For example, sending index 2 would trigger a server response with the text "Super Taco".  What kind of parameters would be most appropriate for this route, query parameters or url parameters?

  <details><summary>click for answer</summary>
  Since we're identifying a single resource, it's best to use url parameters (aka route parameters).
  </details>

3. Create the route you planned in your server file. Following the pattern from the example earlier, your endpoint should include `/api`.

  <details><summary>click for answer</summary>

  ```js
  // server.js
  // Which Taco?
  app.get('/api/tacos/:id', (request, response) => {
    let index = request.params.id;
    let selection = tacos[index] || 'Sorry, that\'s not a taco option';
    response.json( selection );
  });
  ```

  </details>


### POST

Up until now, we've used the HTTP method `GET` to _retrieve_ data from web APIs - either third-party APIs or a few very simple ones we've created.  

_But what if we want to let our users store data?_

When one wants to store data - or **create new resources** on a server, the standard is to use `POST`.


#### Client-side `POST` Review

You can use `POST` directly from an HTML form.

```html
<body>
  <form method="POST" action="http://localhost:3000/api/cities">
    <input id="cityName" name="name" type="text" />
    <input id="cityDesc" name="description" type="text" />
    <input type="submit" />
  </form>
</body>
```

You can also make a `POST` request with AJAX:

```js
// app.js
$.ajax({
  method: "POST",
  url: "http://localhost:3000/api/cities",
  data: $('#city-form').serialize(),
  success: handleCityCreateSuccess,
  error: handleCityCreateError
});

const handleCityCreateSuccess = responseData => {
  console.log("city was successfully created!");
  console.log(`The name of the new city entered is ${responseData.name}`);
  // render book to page
}

const handleError =(jqXHR, status, error) => {  
  console.log(`error: ${error}`);
}
```

Either of those options requires an HTML view with a form.  You can also make HTTP requests with a GUI like Postman or a command line tool like `curl`. Specify `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (or `-d` for `curl`) for easier compatability with our Express server.

#### Server-side `POST` Request Handling

In our Express server, we'll use `app.post` rather than `app.get` to handle `POST` requests.  This way, we can make two routes that use the same path.

In other words, **both the request type and request path must match for the server and client to communicate correctly**.

```js
// server.js
app.post('/api/cities', citiesCreate(request, response) => {
  // save the posted data
});
```

### RESTful Routing Preview

Let's look at _some_ routes for a cities **resource**.  

| HTTP Verb | Route       | RESTful description | Purpose |
| :-------- | ----------- | ------------------- | --------------------|
| GET       | /api/cities     | citiesIndex         | Listing all cities. |
| GET       | /api/cities/:id | citiesShow          | Details of one city. |
| POST      | /api/cities     | citiesCreate        | Create a new city. |
| PUT/PATCH  | /api/cities/:id     | citiesUpdate         | Update one city. |
| DELETE       | /api/cities/:id | citiesDestroy          | Delete one city. |


**REST** is a convention for writing routes in a standard way to make it easier to work with **resources** across the web.  We'll talk more about this, as it's an important theme in modern API design.


### Middleware and `body-parser`

Middleware allows us to intercept the request and response before they're processed by their actual route handler.

POST requests don't use query parameters like GET requests do.  Instead, they submit data in the body of the request.  This looks similar on the client side (the data can still be sent as `data` in jQuery's `ajax` method).

On the server side, we'll use middleware called **body-parser** to help us parse and make use of data from the body of a request.


#### Setting Up `body-parser`

To add the `body-parser` middleware to your app:  

1. Install the `body-parser` module for the project:

  ```bash
  npm install body-parser
  ```

2. Require `body-parser` in your server file:

  ```js
  const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
  ```

3. Include the middleware in the app with `app.use`. (The url encoding is configuration.)

  ```js
  app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
  ```

#### Using `body-parser`

In any routes receiving `POST`ed data, access that data using `request.body`.

```js
app.post('/api/cities', function citiesCreate(request, response) {
  let name = request.body.name;
  let desc = request.body.description;
  let newCity = { name: name, description: desc };
  // if we have a cities array in our app (pre-database):
  cities.push(newCity);
  response.json(cities);
});
```

You can [read more about middleware here](middleware-reading.md).

> Note: for most of our Express apps, we'll include `body-parser` as part of the _boilerplate_ of the app.


### Closing Thoughts

* Use dynamic url parameters, like `/api/burgers/:index` and `/api/tacos/:index`, to request data about a specific resource. Access them on the server in the `request.params` object.
* Use query string parameters for dynamic requests to serve up dynamic responses. Access them on the server in the `request.query` object.
* Use `POST` with named form inputs to send data to our Express servers, and use `body-parser` to access that data as part of the `request.body` object.

This will be essential knowledge for building and interacting with applications that contain multiple resources.  

We'll use `PUT` or `PATCH` to send data to update item information on the server side (instead of `POST`), and we'll use `DELETE` to delete items on the server side.

# Middleware


### What is middleware?

In terms of Express, [middleware](http://expressjs.com/guide/using-middleware.html) is a function with access to the request object (`request`), the response object (`response`), and the next middleware in the application’s request-response cycle, commonly denoted by a variable named `next`.

Middleware can:

* Execute any code.
* Make changes to the request and the response objects.
* End the request-response cycle.
* Call the next middleware in the stack.

You can create your own middleware, or use third-party modules. There are tons of useful middleware modules that are already out there which you can use to handle common challenges like authentication, validation, and parsing.

The [`body-parser`](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) module is an example of some middleware that makes Express awesome. You can use it to parse out data from an HTTP request's body. This provides a different way to collect data instead of relying on URL or query parameters.


##### Including Middleware on One Route

`server.js`
```js
var express = require('express');
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var app = express();

// bodyParser.urlencoded() returns a function that will be called later in the app.post() route
var parseUrlencoded = bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false});

// store for cities in memory (as long as server is running)
var cities = [];

app.get('/cities', function(req, res) {
  res.json({cities: cities});
})

// passing multiple middleware functions to this route; they are executed sequentially
app.post('/cities', parseUrlencoded, function (request, response) {
  //                ^- middleware -^
  var city;
  var name = request.body.name;
  var description = request.body.description;
  city = { name: name, description: description}
  cities.push(city);

  // sending json
  response.json({ cities: cities});
});
```

##### Including Middleware on All Routes

Another way to include middleware is via `app.use`.  This will include it on *all* routes.

```js
var express = require('express');
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var app = express();

// store for cities in memory (as long as server is running)
var cities = [];

// body parser config for all routes
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
//    ^              middleware            ^

app.get('/cities', function(req, res) {
  res.json({cities: cities});
})

app.post('/cities', function (request, response) {
  var city;
  var name = request.body.name;
  var description = request.body.description;
  city = { name: name, description: description }
  cities.push(city);

  // sending json
  response.json({ cities: cities });
});

```

#### Check for Understanding

1. What will the client see when it `GET`s `/cities`?

  <details><summary>click for answer</summary>
  ```
  {
    cities: []  
  }
  ```
  </details>

2. Write code for an HTML form that would `POST` to the `/cities` route.

  <details><summary>click for answer</summary>


  ```html
  <html>
  <body>
    <form method="POST" action="http://localhost:3000/cities">
      <label for"cityName">city</label>
      <input id="cityName" name="name" type="text" />
      <label for"cityDesc">description</label>
      <input id="cityDesc" name="description" type="text" />
      <input type="submit" />
    </form>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```
  </details>

### Custom Middleware

We can write our own middleware. Let's say we want to make some alteration to the request parameters so that further down the chain those alterations can be used.  


```js
// express will call this function on every route with the param of 'name'
app.param('name', function(request, response, next) {
  // get name from params
  var name = request.params.name;
  // capitalize the name
  var capitalizedName = name[0].toUpperCase() + name.slice(1).toLowerCase();
  // set the value of the name to the capitalized version
  request.params.name = capitalizedName;
  // pass control to the next middleware function
  next();
})

app.get("/greet/:name", function (req, res) {
  res.send( "Hello, " + req.params.name );
});
```

Now every name will be capitalized, both for the `GET /greet/:name` route above and for any others with a name parameter.

- get request params
app.get('/greetings/:name', (request, response) => {
  // eval(require('locus')); // helps you to see the request obj
  console.log(request.params); // { name: 'Heggy' }
  // URL parameters let us add dynamic routes to the application. In Express, parameters in a URL are indicated by a colon : and any variable name you want to use. We'll use :name for the example below.
  response.send("Hello, " + request.params.name);
});

In the route above, :name is considered a route or URL parameter. Inside the route's callback, the parameter is accessible with request.params.name.

15 MINUTES
DIRECTIONS: 
Use this time to explore the job postings listed in the previous 5 slides! Remember, you want to be identifying 5-6 platforms you can check on a weekly basis in your job search.
  ### "junior junior dev tech role": 0-2 year experience.  (0-3 yr prior tech experience) 
Create a new bookmarks folder - Job Search Platforms
Test the job search platforms on the following slides + any you find on your own.
Bookmark any strong platforms that:
Include results for junior level positions (0 - 2 years experience)
Have strong filters
Allow you to set filter for location (ex: within 5 miles of Oakland, CA)
- My pick
1) Kapor

- Any types of comanies/organizations: the may not user 3rd party
  * startup with not much money to pay to post a job

- Even before submitting an application(!), you should research to find out if you “connect” to the available job position in the following ways:

Skills (Technical)
Skills ( Soft / Non-Technical)
Past Experience (directly related or loosely related)
Industry / Sector ( relevant to your past academic or work experience)
Company Culture / Work Environment
Company’s Mission
Company’s Primary Product or Service
Industry / Sector ( relevant to your past academic or work experience)

- Today I will cover a structured process you can utilize to complete “information gathering” per job application you submit.

Like any new skills, this “info gathering” process will likely take longer the first few times you implement it.

However, it should only take 5-10 minutes per job application once you’ve mastered it!**


**In submitting 15-35 job postings per week, I realize you may not complete this process for every job application you submit.
you’re researching more information about:
What the heck do I mean by “information gathering?”

The act of completing online research to learn more about an available opportunity.
Compiling this information in a single location to be utilized for your application and/or interviews (ideally).

The job description
The team (may not exist publically)
The company
- Why is  “information gathering?” relevant?

You should never treat an available job as if it lives “in a vacuum” (as if there is no other information beyond what a job description contains).
Your online research can highlight additional reasons you are a strong fit for the available position and/or a complementary addition to the existing culture at the company.

- THE JOB DESCRIPTION

What am I looking for?
- MODELING THE PROCESS

Common keywords: if you don't know what it means google it!

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Demonstrate a working knowledge of object properties and methods.
- Create objects using constructor notation and instances of those objects using the new keyword.
- Compare and contrast creating objects using literal notation vs. constructor notation.
- Define methods on custom objects by attaching them to the prototype.
- Understand object inheritance.


### STUDENT PRE-WORK
*Before this lesson, you should already be able to:*

- Create variables in JavaScript.
- Differentiate between data types (strings, numbers, Booleans).
- Use `if` `else if` and `else` statements to control program flow based on Boolean conditions.
- Create arrays and access/manipulate elements in arrays.
- Create objects with multiple properties and methods and add and retrieve properties.

---
<a name="opening"></a>
## Opening
- Review current lesson objectives.

Before we get started, watch this short [case study](https://generalassembly.wistia.com/medias/0bgiqqwd68) in which a developer describes the role that Object Oriented Programming (OOP) plays in his personal workflow and in programming in general.

Understanding OOP concepts gives us an excellent frame of reference for a lot of information that comes later in the course. OOP concepts are the most common way that developers think about organizing code at a high level.

OOP is a common pattern throughout many languages. Its patterns will enable you to write more readable, organized, and declarative programs. Simply put, understanding Object Oriented Programming will make us better developers.


**Check:** Think about a game of soccer. Let's think about all the pieces that make up that game. What are they? What are some of their properties, i.e., things that describe them? How about their methods, what do they do?



### Review: What is an Object?
So far in this course, we have been writing our JavaScript code using mainly functions, strings, numbers, and arrays.

In our intro lesson on objects, we introduced objects as a way to store and work with more complex data.

Before we begin, let's review what objects look like by examining the following object:

```js
var superman = {
  // Properties
  firstName: "Clark",
  lastName: "Kent",
  superheroName: "Superman",

  // Method
  revealIdentity: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + " is " + this.superheroName;
  }
};
```

*We can assume that an object is a collection of properties (key & value pairs) that all have some sort of relationship, connected logically to one another.*  

<a name="constructor-notation"></a>
## Guided Practice: Constructor Notation
There might be instances where we want to create multiple objects to represent similar things.

For example, if we built a superhero fan site, we'd want to store similar information for a range of superheroes: first name, last name, superhero name, etc.

To do this, we can create a "template" object that contains any properties and methods we want to add for each superhero.

<img src="assets/Slide-3-Superhero-Fan-Site.svg" width="300px">


#### Model a Hero

Now let's imagine that we want to create a new superhero object for Batman.

Let's assume that it looks something like this:

```js
var batman = {
  // Properties
  firstName: "Bruce",
  lastName: "Wayne",
  superheroName: "Batman",

  // Method
  revealIdentity: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + " is " + this.superheroName;
  }
};
```

#### Check - Think/Pair/Share:

> What features do Superman and Batman share? Remember to think about attributes and methods when you're modeling. Also, take note of what differs between them. What other properties might they share?

Make a diagram of our hero entity based on the above objects.


#### Enter Constructor Notation

We can create object templates with a function called a constructor.

Constructor notation can be used to:

1.  Create a single, empty object.
2.  Create multiple instances of similar objects.

#### Creating an Object Using Constructor Notation

First, let's take a look at how we can create a single, empty object using constructor notation.


Take a look:

```js
var superman = new Object();
```

Here, we save our object to the variable `superman`.

Then, we create the new object by using the `new` keyword followed by the object constructor.

The result is an empty Superman object. It doesn't have any associated properties or methods yet, so we need to add them.

#### Adding Properties
We can add properties to our object using either the dot notation (`.`) or square bracket syntax (`[ ]`).

```js
superman.firstName = 'Clark';
superman.lastName = 'Kent';
superman.superheroName = 'Superman';
```

We can add methods to our objects using the dot notation:

```js
superman.revealIdentity = function () {
return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + " is " + this.superheroName;
};
```

#### Accessing/Updating Properties
We can also access and update properties using either the dot notation or square bracket syntax, just as we did with our object literals:

```js
// Accessing Values
var heroFirst = superman.firstName;

// Updating Values
superman.firstName = 'Bill';
superman['superheroName'] = 'Super Duper Man';
```

#### Exercise:

1.  Create an object `currentlyListening`
2.  Add the following properties to your object:

*   The `album` is "Wild Honey"
*   The `artist` is "The Beach Boys"
*   The `releaseDate` is 1967
*   The `label` is "Capitol Records"


Answer option 1:

```js
var currentlyListening = new Object();
currentlyListening.album = "Wild Honey";
currentlyListening.artist = "The Beach Boys";
currentlyListening.releaseDate = 1967;
currentlyListening.label = "Capitol Records";
```

Answer option 2:

```js
var currentlyListening = new Object();
currentlyListening["album"] = "Wild Honey";
currentlyListening["artist"] = "The Beach Boys";
currentlyListening["releaseDate"] = 1967;
currentlyListening["label"] = "Capitol Records";
```

## Creating Multiple Objects Using Constructor Notation

Whew! With that under our belt, it's now time to create many objects using **constructor notation**.

The real power of constructor notation comes into play when we create multiple objects to represent similar things.

Think about our superhero fan site.

As you'll recall, we want a way to store similar info for many superheroes: first name, last name, superhero name, etc.

We need to create a "template" object, which contains the properties we want to add for each superhero.

However, because of how prototypical inheritance works, it's a little bit more than just a template, as instances of an object have links to the object that created them. We'll discuss this later in the lesson.

#### Constructor Function
To create this object template, we use a function called a **constructor**.

This is really just a function like any other, but when you call it in a particular way, JavaScript works its magic.

Let's see an example of an object constructor function.

Here, we are creating a `Superhero` function. It's just like creating any other function in JavaScript.

```js
var Superhero = function () {};
```

Note that it is convention to _capitalize the name of the function_ when creating a constructor function. We'll take a look at this again in a moment.


#### Creating Object Instances
Creating an instance of our `Superhero` object is similar to creating a new empty object using constructor notation:

```js
var clark = new Superhero();
var bruce = new Superhero();
```


Here, we save our new objects to the variables `clark` and `bruce`. We use the `new` keyword, similar to when we created a new empty object above. We then use the name of the constructor function `Superhero`, followed by parenthesis `()`.

Note that the name of a constructor function usually begins with a capital letter — unlike other functions — to remind developers to use the `new` keyword when creating an object using that function.


The constructor function is called at the moment that our `new` object is **instantiated**.

For example:

```js
var Superhero = function () {
  console.log('Superhero instance created');
};

var clark = new Superhero();
=> "Superhero instance created"

var bruce = new Superhero();
=> "Superhero instance created"
```

Messages are logged to the console as soon as we create a new instance of our object.

#### Setting Up Properties/Methods
Up until this point, we've set property names manually, for every new object we create.

The point of our objects/constructors is to create blueprints of our data models, so that when we create a new instance, we can change particular properties instead of resetting all of the object's keys.


Properties can be set in the constructor so they are set specifically for each instance. In other words, we pass them as arguments in our constructor function.

Take a look at the following example:

```js
var Superhero = function (firstName, lastName, superheroName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
  this.superheroName = superheroName;
  this.revealIdentity = function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + " is " + this.SuperheroName;
  }
};
```

Let's break this down, line-by-line.


1. Overview: We are using a constructor function to create a template for our `Superhero` objects.
2. We pass three parameters, i.e., the property names each superhero will have in common: `firstName`, `lastName`, and `superheroName`.
3. The object properties `firstName`, `lastName`, and `superheroName` are then set through the `this` keyword with the value.
4. Within the function, `firstName` refers to the parameter name we passed to the function. Same with `lastName` and `superheroName`.
5. We then add a method for our object, similar to how we've done it in the past. To add a method, we use the method name `revealIdentity`, followed by an equal sign, followed by an anonymous function (a function without a name).
6. Within the function, we use `this` to access the properties of the instance of the individual object we are creating.

> Note: We defined a method inside the the Superhero constructor here. JavaScript allows it, but don't do it. We'll see the right way to achieve a near identical and preferred result shortly.


#### Creating an Instance
Creating an instance of our `Superhero` object will look like this:


```js
var superman = new Superhero('Clark', 'Kent', 'Superman');
```

```js
var batman = new Superhero('Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Batman');
```

1. Use the `new` keyword followed by the name of our constructor function `Superhero`.

2. Pass in three arguments, which are the property values that correspond to the three parameters we passed into our `Superhero` constructor function: `firstName`, `lastName`, and `superheroName`.


We've now created two new instances of our Superhero object!

<img src="assets/Slide-19-Charts.svg" width="500px">

We can create as many superheroes as we want using our `Superhero` constructor function.

We also have a blueprint, or template, of our object. So in the future, when we create a new instance, we won't need to reset all of the keys. All we'll have to do is give values for different properties.

#### Accessing Properties and Methods

We can now access properties of our object instances using dot or square bracket notation:

```js
console.log(superman.firstName + ' ' + superman.lastName);
=> 'Clark Kent'
```

Notice our `revealIdentity` method is also copied over to each individual object.

```js
superman.revealIdentity();
=> 'Clark Kent is Superman'

batman.revealIdentity();
=> 'Bruce Wayne is Batman'
```


Creating objects is now much more scalable than if we used literal notation to create every individual object.

Our code will also be cleaner, as we avoid repetition when creating similar objects.

#### this

In the last lesson, we covered how to use the `this` keyword to access properties and methods for our objects.

We also mentioned that `this` is used in place of the object name to refer to the current object instance.

However, when we create several objects using constructor notation, `this` refers to the individual instance of that object.

Let's look at an example:

```js
function Pet (name, species, breed, noise)  {
  this.name = name;
  this.species = species;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.noise =  noise;
  this.makeNoise = function () {
    console.log(this.noise);
  }
}

var wolfman = new Pet('Wolfman', 'cat', 'Tuxedo Cat', 'meow');
var rover = new Pet('Rover', 'dog', 'Golden Retriever', 'bark');
```

<img src="assets/Slide-12-Cat-Tux-Meow.svg" width="300px">


Here, `this` refers to the individual instance of the object we are creating.

So when we create our `wolfman` object, `this` will refer to the `wolfman` object, and `this.noise` will return `'meow'`.

When we create our `rover` object, `this` will refer to our rover object, and `this.noise` will return `'bark'`.


#### Check:

Test yourself! See if you can guess what `this` refers to in the following situations:

```js
function Pet (name, species, breed, noise)  {
  this.name = name;
  this.species = species;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.noise =  noise;
  this.makeNoise = function () {
    console.log(this.noise);
  }
};

var batman = new Pet('Batman', 'bird', 'parrot', 'chirp');
```

When we create our `batman` object, what will `this` refer to? What will be logged to the console from within the `makeNoise` method?

`console.log(this.noise);`

> Answer:  
`this` will refer to `batman`.  
`this.noise` will return `'chirp'`.


***

<a name="methods"></a>
## Object Methods
One of the most powerful features of JavaScript objects are methods, which we covered briefly last lesson.

Methods are *"functions"* that are predefined and built into an object.  

We all know and love array methods such as `forEach()`, `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`; these are all methods of the `Array` object.  

Let's use Constructor Notation to create a flower object that uses a `bloom` method to output to the console whenever we call it.

```javascript
function Flower (color, petals, smells) {
    this.color = color;
    this.petals = petals;
    this.smells = smells;
    // Demonstrates a simple method in an object
    this.bloom = function() {
        console.log("Look at me!");
    };
};
```

We now have a method inside our flower object called `bloom`.

But there's an issue with the above code. If we create multiple flowers, we don't care if the attributes `color`, `petal`, and `smells` all have different values. It makes sense for these values to be different and customizable for each flower.

However, all flowers could _share_ the `bloom` method. What we want to avoid is creating an entirely new `bloom` method every time we make a new flower.

```javascript
var lily = new Flower("yellow", 6, true);
var rose = new Flower("red", 32, true);

lily.bloom === rose.bloom;
=> false
```

But we want their bloom methods to be the same!


***

<a name="prototypes"></a>
## Prototypes

All objects have internal links to other objects &mdash; we refer to these "other objects" as "prototypes"; and these prototype objects will have inherited prototypes of their own. This goes on until we find an object with a `null` prototype. By definition, `null` does not have a prototype; it acts as the end of the prototype chain.

![spyqq7jwqubh4oyfvqnnw7g](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/40461/8396752/737ff1c0-1dab-11e5-83b0-4f380980b2b5.png)

We know that objects are basically key/value pairs. When you ask for a key's value from an object, JavaScript will first look to find the value in the instance of the object; and then, if it doesn't exist, it will look for that object's prototype 'default value.'

Note that this inheritance chain can go as long as you want; but generally, it's better to keep it short and have your code easier to understand.

#### Prototypes as Pointers

The easiest way to see prototypes in JavaScript are as pointers that other objects saved on the current object. Take a look at the diagram below:

![prototype-diagram](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/40461/8397563/f78b92c8-1dc7-11e5-97fc-79a56d682626.png)

#### Adding Methods to our Flower Object

Using a prototype will enable us to easily define methods to all instances created by a constructor function while saving memory. What's great is that the method will only be applied to the prototype of the object, so it is only stored in the memory once, because objects coming from the same constructor point to one common prototype object.

By adding the method `bloom` to the constructor's **prototype**, we can enable all flowers to share a `bloom` method, or any other method for that matter!

```javascript
function Flower (color, petals, smells) {
    this.color = color;
    this.petals = petals;
    this.smells = smells;
};

Flower.prototype = {
  bloom: function() {
    console.log("Look at me!");
  }
};
```

Now try running the same test to see if both flowers share the same `bloom` method.

```javascript
var lily = new Flower("yellow", 6, true);
var rose = new Flower("red", 32, true);

lily.bloom === rose.bloom;
=> true
```

#### Benefits of this approach
- Less wasted memory.
- Single source of truth.

>What if we edit the prototype *after* the flower instances have been created? Will they update their behavior accordingly?

<!-- Pass out flowers or have each student choose one of the flower images in the images folder -->

#### More methods
Let's add some more methods to the flower constructor.

```javascript
function Flower(color, petals, smells) {
    this.color = color;
    this.petals = petals;
    this.smells = smells;
};

Flower.prototype = {
  bloom: function() {
    console.log("Look at me!");
  },
  smellsGood: function() {
  // use 'this' to access the instance's attributes
    if (this.smells) {
      return 'This flower smells amazing!';
    } else {
      return 'What a noxious weed!';
    }
  },
  describe: function() {
    console.log("This flower is " + this.color + ".");    
  }
};
```

Methods can also access properties within the object with the `this` identifier, rather than using dot or bracket notation.

#### Quick Challenge - Wilt & Water

- Create a `wilt()` method that decrements each flower by one petal. :(
- Create a `water()` method that increments each flower by one petal. :)

<a name="modeling-flowers"></a>
## Independent Practice: Modeling Flowers

Pick one of the flowers in the [starter code folder](starter_code/flowers).

Decide amongst your tablemates the type of flower, the flower's main color, number of petals, and whether or not it smells pretty. Think up some other possible properties or methods. Try to think of at least three.

1. Take five minutes to create a Flower object that includes the properties/methods you discussed as a group, based on the flower on your table, using a Constructor function. Then create a flower instance for your individual flower.
2. Take another couple minutes to create a flower instance based on your neighbor's flower.

> Check: Now we should have a flower instance for each of our actual flowers.
>
> Let's source the best new properties that were created on their constructors and integrate them into a universal flower constructor.

***

<a name="classes-in-js"></a>
## Classes in JS

Post ES6 classes are defined in JavaScript. These are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. 

```javascript
class Flower {
	constructor(color, petals, smells){
		this.color = color;
		this.petals = petals;
		this.smells = smells;
	}
}
```

An important difference between function declarations and class declarations is that function declarations are hoisted and class declarations are not. You first need to declare your class and then access it, otherwise code like the following will throw a ReferenceError:

```javascript
const flower = new Flower();

class Flower{}
```

#### Constructor

The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. There can only be one special method with the name "constructor" in a class. A SyntaxError will be thrown if the class contains more than one occurrence of a constructor method.

#### Methods

Each class can have a number of related methods.

```javascript
class Flower {
	constructor(color, petals, smells){
		this.color = color;
		this.petals = petals;
		this.smells = smells;
	}
	
	getColor(){
		return this.color;
	}
}
```

### Extending a class

A class can be made a child of another class by using ```extends``` keyword. The child class will inherit all the properties and methods of parent class.

A classic example of this is,

```javascript
class Animal{
	constructor(name, type="unknown"){
		this.name = name;
		this.type = type;
	}
	
	getName(){
		return this.name;
	}
	
	speak(){
		console.log(`${this.name} makes some noise.`);
	}
}

class Cat extends Animal{
	constructor(name, isDomestic){
		super(name, 'carnivore');
		this.isDomestic = isDomestic;
	}
	
	canBeDomesticated(){
		return this.isDomestic;
	}
	
	speak(){
		super.speak();
		console.log(`${this.name} meows.`)
	}	
}
```
>```super``` is used to call the constructor/method of Parent class.

<a name="modeling-flowers"></a>
## Independent Practice: Modeling Flowers with Classes

Pick one of the flowers in the [starter code folder](starter_code/flowers).

Recreate the above flower object with a Flower class. The type of flower can be a child class of the Flower class. 

Try to call methods and properties from both parent and child class. Also, call overriden methods from child class with and without ```super``` keyword. Try to guess the output before executing the code.

> If time permits, then merge child flower classes of your neighbour and source the best new properties/methods that were created and integrate them into a universal flower Base class.

***


<a name="cross-pollination"></a>
## Guided Practice: Cross-Pollination (10 mins) (If Time Permits)
Now that we are awesome Flower experts, let's try our hand at cross-pollinating two flower objects. Cross-pollinating is beyond the realm of an individual flower and could therefore live on the Flower constructor itself. Other examples of this would be `create`, `new`, or `destroy`. These are all *meta* actions of a flower; a flower cannot create itself! They are called **static methods**.

Check: Think-pair-share - How might we declare this method?

To exemplify this, let's create a static method (also sometimes refered to as a class method) called `crossPollinate`, as opposed to the instance methods we've been making (e.g., `bloom`).

- The method will take two flower instances as arguments.    
- Return a new flower instance that is a mix of both "parent" colors (i.e., red, yellow = "red-yellow"; we don't care about the color wheel).
- Make the new petal count an average between the two parents' petal counts.
- The smellPretty gene is recessive, unfortunately. This means that a flower will smell pretty IF and only IF both flowers smell pretty.  

<details>
<summary>Example solution</summary>

```javascript
// constructor
function Flower(color, petals, smells) {
    this.color = color;
    this.petals = petals;
    this.smells = smells;
}

// static methods
Flower.crossPollinate = function(momFlower, dadFlower) {
  var color = momFlower.color + "-" + dadFlower.color;
  var petals = (momFlower.petals + dadFlower.petals) / 2;
  var smells = momFlower.smells && dadFlower.smells;
  var babyFlower = new Flower(color, petals, smells);
  return babyFlower;
}

// instance methods
Flower.prototype = {
  bloom: function() {
    console.log("Look at me!");
  },
  smellsGood: function() {
    if (this.smells) {
      return 'This flower smells amazing!';
    } else {
      return 'What a noxious weed!';
    }
  },
  describe: function() {
    // Demonstrates use of local object variables
    // use `this` to access the instance's attributes
    console.log("This flower is " + this.color + ".");    
  }
}


var lily = new Flower("blue", 32, true);
var rose = new Flower("green", 12, true);

var rily = Flower.crossPollinate(rose, lily);

rily.smellsGood();
```

</details>

**Thought experiment:** *Maybe we create a different intermediary object, called Bee, which would facilitate cross-pollination and return a new flower? Flowers don't just bash their heads together and make new flowers in the real world; they need bees! What are some methods we could assign to a Bee object?*

***

<a name="conclusion"></a>
## Conclusion
Almost everything in JavaScript either is an object or inherits from an object. As you walk around the outside world, start thinking: "How could I write that as a JavaScript object?"

What properties do people on the train have? What about the train itself?

That's how most JavaScript developers think, to one degree or another: "I want to create a game, or an app, how would I model all my objects?"

* Why is using a prototype useful?
* Would you typically put the methods or attributes in the prototype?
* When would we use static methods?

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Demonstrate a working knowledge of object properties and methods.
- Create objects using constructor notation and instances of those objects using the new keyword.
- Compare and contrast creating objects using literal notation vs. constructor notation.
- Define methods on custom objects by attaching them to the prototype.
- Understand object inheritance.


### STUDENT PRE-WORK
*Before this lesson, you should already be able to:*

- Create variables in JavaScript.
- Differentiate between data types (strings, numbers, Booleans).
- Use `if` `else if` and `else` statements to control program flow based on Boolean conditions.
- Create arrays and access/manipulate elements in arrays.
- Create objects with multiple properties and methods and add and retrieve properties.

---
<a name="opening"></a>
## Opening
- Review current lesson objectives.

Before we get started, watch this short [case study](https://generalassembly.wistia.com/medias/0bgiqqwd68) in which a developer describes the role that Object Oriented Programming (OOP) plays in his personal workflow and in programming in general.

Understanding OOP concepts gives us an excellent frame of reference for a lot of information that comes later in the course. OOP concepts are the most common way that developers think about organizing code at a high level.

OOP is a common pattern throughout many languages. Its patterns will enable you to write more readable, organized, and declarative programs. Simply put, understanding Object Oriented Programming will make us better developers.


**Check:** Think about a game of soccer. Let's think about all the pieces that make up that game. What are they? What are some of their properties, i.e., things that describe them? How about their methods, what do they do?



### Review: What is an Object?
So far in this course, we have been writing our JavaScript code using mainly functions, strings, numbers, and arrays.

In our intro lesson on objects, we introduced objects as a way to store and work with more complex data.

Before we begin, let's review what objects look like by examining the following object:

```js
var superman = {
  // Properties
  firstName: "Clark",
  lastName: "Kent",
  superheroName: "Superman",

  // Method
  revealIdentity: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + " is " + this.superheroName;
  }
};
```

*We can assume that an object is a collection of properties (key & value pairs) that all have some sort of relationship, connected logically to one another.*  

<a name="constructor-notation"></a>
## Guided Practice: Constructor Notation
There might be instances where we want to create multiple objects to represent similar things.

For example, if we built a superhero fan site, we'd want to store similar information for a range of superheroes: first name, last name, superhero name, etc.

To do this, we can create a "template" object that contains any properties and methods we want to add for each superhero.

<img src="assets/Slide-3-Superhero-Fan-Site.svg" width="300px">


#### Model a Hero

Now let's imagine that we want to create a new superhero object for Batman.

Let's assume that it looks something like this:

```js
var batman = {
  // Properties
  firstName: "Bruce",
  lastName: "Wayne",
  superheroName: "Batman",

  // Method
  revealIdentity: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + " is " + this.superheroName;
  }
};
```

#### Check - Think/Pair/Share:

> What features do Superman and Batman share? Remember to think about attributes and methods when you're modeling. Also, take note of what differs between them. What other properties might they share?

Make a diagram of our hero entity based on the above objects.


#### Enter Constructor Notation

We can create object templates with a function called a constructor.

Constructor notation can be used to:

1.  Create a single, empty object.
2.  Create multiple instances of similar objects.

#### Creating an Object Using Constructor Notation

First, let's take a look at how we can create a single, empty object using constructor notation.


Take a look:

```js
var superman = new Object();
```

Here, we save our object to the variable `superman`.

Then, we create the new object by using the `new` keyword followed by the object constructor.

The result is an empty Superman object. It doesn't have any associated properties or methods yet, so we need to add them.

#### Adding Properties
We can add properties to our object using either the dot notation (`.`) or square bracket syntax (`[ ]`).

```js
superman.firstName = 'Clark';
superman.lastName = 'Kent';
superman.superheroName = 'Superman';
```

We can add methods to our objects using the dot notation:

```js
superman.revealIdentity = function () {
return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + " is " + this.superheroName;
};
```

#### Accessing/Updating Properties
We can also access and update properties using either the dot notation or square bracket syntax, just as we did with our object literals:

```js
// Accessing Values
var heroFirst = superman.firstName;

// Updating Values
superman.firstName = 'Bill';
superman['superheroName'] = 'Super Duper Man';
```

#### Exercise:

1.  Create an object `currentlyListening`
2.  Add the following properties to your object:

*   The `album` is "Wild Honey"
*   The `artist` is "The Beach Boys"
*   The `releaseDate` is 1967
*   The `label` is "Capitol Records"


Answer option 1:

```js
var currentlyListening = new Object();
currentlyListening.album = "Wild Honey";
currentlyListening.artist = "The Beach Boys";
currentlyListening.releaseDate = 1967;
currentlyListening.label = "Capitol Records";
```

Answer option 2:

```js
var currentlyListening = new Object();
currentlyListening["album"] = "Wild Honey";
currentlyListening["artist"] = "The Beach Boys";
currentlyListening["releaseDate"] = 1967;
currentlyListening["label"] = "Capitol Records";
```

<a name="multiple-objects"></a>
## Creating Multiple Objects Using Constructor Notation

Whew! With that under our belt, it's now time to create many objects using **constructor notation**.

The real power of constructor notation comes into play when we create multiple objects to represent similar things.

Think about our superhero fan site.

As you'll recall, we want a way to store similar info for many superheroes: first name, last name, superhero name, etc.

We need to create a "template" object, which contains the properties we want to add for each superhero.

However, because of how prototypical inheritance works, it's a little bit more than just a template, as instances of an object have links to the object that created them. We'll discuss this later in the lesson.

#### Constructor Function
To create this object template, we use a function called a **constructor**.

This is really just a function like any other, but when you call it in a particular way, JavaScript works its magic.

Let's see an example of an object constructor function.

Here, we are creating a `Superhero` function. It's just like creating any other function in JavaScript.

```js
var Superhero = function () {};
```

Note that it is convention to _capitalize the name of the function_ when creating a constructor function. We'll take a look at this again in a moment.


#### Creating Object Instances
Creating an instance of our `Superhero` object is similar to creating a new empty object using constructor notation:

```js
var clark = new Superhero();
var bruce = new Superhero();
```


Here, we save our new objects to the variables `clark` and `bruce`. We use the `new` keyword, similar to when we created a new empty object above. We then use the name of the constructor function `Superhero`, followed by parenthesis `()`.

Note that the name of a constructor function usually begins with a capital letter — unlike other functions — to remind developers to use the `new` keyword when creating an object using that function.


The constructor function is called at the moment that our `new` object is **instantiated**.

For example:

```js
var Superhero = function () {
  console.log('Superhero instance created');
};

var clark = new Superhero();
=> "Superhero instance created"

var bruce = new Superhero();
=> "Superhero instance created"
```

Messages are logged to the console as soon as we create a new instance of our object.

#### Setting Up Properties/Methods
Up until this point, we've set property names manually, for every new object we create.

The point of our objects/constructors is to create blueprints of our data models, so that when we create a new instance, we can change particular properties instead of resetting all of the object's keys.


Properties can be set in the constructor so they are set specifically for each instance. In other words, we pass them as arguments in our constructor function.

Take a look at the following example:

```js
var Superhero = function (firstName, lastName, superheroName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
  this.superheroName = superheroName;
  this.revealIdentity = function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + " is " + this.SuperheroName;
  }
};
```

Let's break this down, line-by-line.


1. Overview: We are using a constructor function to create a template for our `Superhero` objects.
2. We pass three parameters, i.e., the property names each superhero will have in common: `firstName`, `lastName`, and `superheroName`.
3. The object properties `firstName`, `lastName`, and `superheroName` are then set through the `this` keyword with the value.
4. Within the function, `firstName` refers to the parameter name we passed to the function. Same with `lastName` and `superheroName`.
5. We then add a method for our object, similar to how we've done it in the past. To add a method, we use the method name `revealIdentity`, followed by an equal sign, followed by an anonymous function (a function without a name).
6. Within the function, we use `this` to access the properties of the instance of the individual object we are creating.

> Note: We defined a method inside the the Superhero constructor here. JavaScript allows it, but don't do it. We'll see the right way to achieve a near identical and preferred result shortly.


#### Creating an Instance
Creating an instance of our `Superhero` object will look like this:


```js
var superman = new Superhero('Clark', 'Kent', 'Superman');
```

```js
var batman = new Superhero('Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Batman');
```

1. Use the `new` keyword followed by the name of our constructor function `Superhero`.

2. Pass in three arguments, which are the property values that correspond to the three parameters we passed into our `Superhero` constructor function: `firstName`, `lastName`, and `superheroName`.


We've now created two new instances of our Superhero object!

<img src="assets/Slide-19-Charts.svg" width="500px">

We can create as many superheroes as we want using our `Superhero` constructor function.

We also have a blueprint, or template, of our object. So in the future, when we create a new instance, we won't need to reset all of the keys. All we'll have to do is give values for different properties.

#### Accessing Properties and Methods

We can now access properties of our object instances using dot or square bracket notation:

```js
console.log(superman.firstName + ' ' + superman.lastName);
=> 'Clark Kent'
```

Notice our `revealIdentity` method is also copied over to each individual object.

```js
superman.revealIdentity();
=> 'Clark Kent is Superman'

batman.revealIdentity();
=> 'Bruce Wayne is Batman'
```


Creating objects is now much more scalable than if we used literal notation to create every individual object.

Our code will also be cleaner, as we avoid repetition when creating similar objects.

#### this

In the last lesson, we covered how to use the `this` keyword to access properties and methods for our objects.

We also mentioned that `this` is used in place of the object name to refer to the current object instance.

However, when we create several objects using constructor notation, `this` refers to the individual instance of that object.

Let's look at an example:

```js
function Pet (name, species, breed, noise)  {
  this.name = name;
  this.species = species;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.noise =  noise;
  this.makeNoise = function () {
    console.log(this.noise);
  }
}

var wolfman = new Pet('Wolfman', 'cat', 'Tuxedo Cat', 'meow');
var rover = new Pet('Rover', 'dog', 'Golden Retriever', 'bark');
```

<img src="assets/Slide-12-Cat-Tux-Meow.svg" width="300px">


Here, `this` refers to the individual instance of the object we are creating.

So when we create our `wolfman` object, `this` will refer to the `wolfman` object, and `this.noise` will return `'meow'`.

When we create our `rover` object, `this` will refer to our rover object, and `this.noise` will return `'bark'`.


#### Check:

Test yourself! See if you can guess what `this` refers to in the following situations:

```js
function Pet (name, species, breed, noise)  {
  this.name = name;
  this.species = species;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.noise =  noise;
  this.makeNoise = function () {
    console.log(this.noise);
  }
};

var batman = new Pet('Batman', 'bird', 'parrot', 'chirp');
```

When we create our `batman` object, what will `this` refer to? What will be logged to the console from within the `makeNoise` method?

`console.log(this.noise);`

> Answer:  
`this` will refer to `batman`.  
`this.noise` will return `'chirp'`.


***

<a name="methods"></a>
## Object Methods
One of the most powerful features of JavaScript objects are methods, which we covered briefly last lesson.

Methods are *"functions"* that are predefined and built into an object.  

We all know and love array methods such as `forEach()`, `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`; these are all methods of the `Array` object.  

Let's use Constructor Notation to create a flower object that uses a `bloom` method to output to the console whenever we call it.

```javascript
function Flower (color, petals, smells) {
    this.color = color;
    this.petals = petals;
    this.smells = smells;
    // Demonstrates a simple method in an object
    this.bloom = function() {
        console.log("Look at me!");
    };
};
```

We now have a method inside our flower object called `bloom`.

But there's an issue with the above code. If we create multiple flowers, we don't care if the attributes `color`, `petal`, and `smells` all have different values. It makes sense for these values to be different and customizable for each flower.

However, all flowers could _share_ the `bloom` method. What we want to avoid is creating an entirely new `bloom` method every time we make a new flower.

```javascript
var lily = new Flower("yellow", 6, true);
var rose = new Flower("red", 32, true);

lily.bloom === rose.bloom;
=> false
```

But we want their bloom methods to be the same!


***

<a name="prototypes"></a>
## Prototypes

All objects have internal links to other objects &mdash; we refer to these "other objects" as "prototypes"; and these prototype objects will have inherited prototypes of their own. This goes on until we find an object with a `null` prototype. By definition, `null` does not have a prototype; it acts as the end of the prototype chain.

![spyqq7jwqubh4oyfvqnnw7g](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/40461/8396752/737ff1c0-1dab-11e5-83b0-4f380980b2b5.png)

We know that objects are basically key/value pairs. When you ask for a key's value from an object, JavaScript will first look to find the value in the instance of the object; and then, if it doesn't exist, it will look for that object's prototype 'default value.'

Note that this inheritance chain can go as long as you want; but generally, it's better to keep it short and have your code easier to understand.

#### Prototypes as Pointers

The easiest way to see prototypes in JavaScript are as pointers that other objects saved on the current object. Take a look at the diagram below:

![prototype-diagram](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/40461/8397563/f78b92c8-1dc7-11e5-97fc-79a56d682626.png)

#### Adding Methods to our Flower Object

Using a prototype will enable us to easily define methods to all instances created by a constructor function while saving memory. What's great is that the method will only be applied to the prototype of the object, so it is only stored in the memory once, because objects coming from the same constructor point to one common prototype object.

By adding the method `bloom` to the constructor's **prototype**, we can enable all flowers to share a `bloom` method, or any other method for that matter!

```javascript
function Flower (color, petals, smells) {
    this.color = color;
    this.petals = petals;
    this.smells = smells;
};

Flower.prototype = {
  bloom: function() {
    console.log("Look at me!");
  }
};
```

Now try running the same test to see if both flowers share the same `bloom` method.

```javascript
var lily = new Flower("yellow", 6, true);
var rose = new Flower("red", 32, true);

lily.bloom === rose.bloom;
=> true
```

#### Benefits of this approach
- Less wasted memory.
- Single source of truth.

>What if we edit the prototype *after* the flower instances have been created? Will they update their behavior accordingly?

<!-- Pass out flowers or have each student choose one of the flower images in the images folder -->

#### More methods
Let's add some more methods to the flower constructor.

```javascript
function Flower(color, petals, smells) {
    this.color = color;
    this.petals = petals;
    this.smells = smells;
};

Flower.prototype = {
  bloom: function() {
    console.log("Look at me!");
  },
  smellsGood: function() {
  // use 'this' to access the instance's attributes
    if (this.smells) {
      return 'This flower smells amazing!';
    } else {
      return 'What a noxious weed!';
    }
  },
  describe: function() {
    console.log("This flower is " + this.color + ".");    
  }
};
```

Methods can also access properties within the object with the `this` identifier, rather than using dot or bracket notation.

#### Quick Challenge - Wilt & Water

- Create a `wilt()` method that decrements each flower by one petal. :(
- Create a `water()` method that increments each flower by one petal. :)

***

<a name="modeling-flowers"></a>
## Independent Practice: Modeling Flowers

Pick one of the flowers in the [starter code folder](starter_code/flowers).

Decide amongst your tablemates the type of flower, the flower's main color, number of petals, and whether or not it smells pretty. Think up some other possible properties or methods. Try to think of at least three.

1. Take five minutes to create a Flower object that includes the properties/methods you discussed as a group, based on the flower on your table, using a Constructor function. Then create a flower instance for your individual flower.
2. Take another couple minutes to create a flower instance based on your neighbor's flower.

> Check: Now we should have a flower instance for each of our actual flowers.
>
> Let's source the best new properties that were created on their constructors and integrate them into a universal flower constructor.

***

<a name="classes-in-js"></a>
## Classes in JS

Post ES6 classes are defined in JavaScript. These are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. 

```javascript
class Flower {
	constructor(color, petals, smells){
		this.color = color;
		this.petals = petals;
		this.smells = smells;
	}
}
```

An important difference between function declarations and class declarations is that function declarations are hoisted and class declarations are not. You first need to declare your class and then access it, otherwise code like the following will throw a ReferenceError:

```javascript
const flower = new Flower();

class Flower{}
```

#### Constructor

The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. There can only be one special method with the name "constructor" in a class. A SyntaxError will be thrown if the class contains more than one occurrence of a constructor method.

#### Methods

Each class can have a number of related methods.

```javascript
class Flower {
	constructor(color, petals, smells){
		this.color = color;
		this.petals = petals;
		this.smells = smells;
	}
	
	getColor(){
		return this.color;
	}
}
```

### Extending a class

A class can be made a child of another class by using ```extends``` keyword. The child class will inherit all the properties and methods of parent class.

A classic example of this is,

```javascript
class Animal{
	constructor(name, type="unknown"){
		this.name = name;
		this.type = type;
	}
	
	getName(){
		return this.name;
	}
	
	speak(){
		console.log(`${this.name} makes some noise.`);
	}
}

class Cat extends Animal{
	constructor(name, isDomestic){
		super(name, 'carnivore');
		this.isDomestic = isDomestic;
	}
	
	canBeDomesticated(){
		return this.isDomestic;
	}
	
	speak(){
		super.speak();
		console.log(`${this.name} meows.`)
	}	
}
```
>```super``` is used to call the constructor/method of Parent class.

<a name="modeling-flowers"></a>
## Independent Practice: Modeling Flowers with Classes

Pick one of the flowers in the [starter code folder](starter_code/flowers).

Recreate the above flower object with a Flower class. The type of flower can be a child class of the Flower class. 

Try to call methods and properties from both parent and child class. Also, call overriden methods from child class with and without ```super``` keyword. Try to guess the output before executing the code.

> If time permits, then merge child flower classes of your neighbour and source the best new properties/methods that were created and integrate them into a universal flower Base class.

***


<a name="cross-pollination"></a>
## Guided Practice: Cross-Pollination (10 mins) (If Time Permits)
Now that we are awesome Flower experts, let's try our hand at cross-pollinating two flower objects. Cross-pollinating is beyond the realm of an individual flower and could therefore live on the Flower constructor itself. Other examples of this would be `create`, `new`, or `destroy`. These are all *meta* actions of a flower; a flower cannot create itself! They are called **static methods**.

Check: Think-pair-share - How might we declare this method?

To exemplify this, let's create a static method (also sometimes refered to as a class method) called `crossPollinate`, as opposed to the instance methods we've been making (e.g., `bloom`).

- The method will take two flower instances as arguments.    
- Return a new flower instance that is a mix of both "parent" colors (i.e., red, yellow = "red-yellow"; we don't care about the color wheel).
- Make the new petal count an average between the two parents' petal counts.
- The smellPretty gene is recessive, unfortunately. This means that a flower will smell pretty IF and only IF both flowers smell pretty.  

<details>
<summary>Example solution</summary>

```javascript
// constructor
function Flower(color, petals, smells) {
    this.color = color;
    this.petals = petals;
    this.smells = smells;
}

// static methods
Flower.crossPollinate = function(momFlower, dadFlower) {
  var color = momFlower.color + "-" + dadFlower.color;
  var petals = (momFlower.petals + dadFlower.petals) / 2;
  var smells = momFlower.smells && dadFlower.smells;
  var babyFlower = new Flower(color, petals, smells);
  return babyFlower;
}

// instance methods
Flower.prototype = {
  bloom: function() {
    console.log("Look at me!");
  },
  smellsGood: function() {
    if (this.smells) {
      return 'This flower smells amazing!';
    } else {
      return 'What a noxious weed!';
    }
  },
  describe: function() {
    // Demonstrates use of local object variables
    // use `this` to access the instance's attributes
    console.log("This flower is " + this.color + ".");    
  }
}


var lily = new Flower("blue", 32, true);
var rose = new Flower("green", 12, true);

var rily = Flower.crossPollinate(rose, lily);

rily.smellsGood();
```

</details>

**Thought experiment:** *Maybe we create a different intermediary object, called Bee, which would facilitate cross-pollination and return a new flower? Flowers don't just bash their heads together and make new flowers in the real world; they need bees! What are some methods we could assign to a Bee object?*

***

<a name="conclusion"></a>
## Conclusion
Almost everything in JavaScript either is an object or inherits from an object. As you walk around the outside world, start thinking: "How could I write that as a JavaScript object?"

What properties do people on the train have? What about the train itself?

That's how most JavaScript developers think, to one degree or another: "I want to create a game, or an app, how would I model all my objects?"

* Why is using a prototype useful?
* Would you typically put the methods or attributes in the prototype?
* When would we use static methods?

# Giffaw

Your goal is to integrate with the Giphy API.

https://developers.giphy.com/docs/

Basic Requirements:

* A user can see the top 25 gifs (on page load)
* A user can search for gifs, using the input field
* Super Bonus: A user can "load more" gifs

Your site should look something like:

![desktop layout](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3010270/13936044/2ffadf60-ef78-11e5-95c5-55b8aefe68d6.png)

Solution in the `solution` branch. Load More button solution in the `solution-more` branch.
```
	git checkout solution
```
OR just view in the browser by selecting the branch you want from the branch dropdown.

## Introduction

You're about to write a lot of AJAX-backed JavaScript using jQuery that will complete our little Gif app.

Make use of the fantastic Giphy api:
http://api.giphy.com/

Check out the documentation here:
https://developers.giphy.com/docs/

#### Thinking Like An Engineer

As we get into more complicated problems, we need to start thinking more and more like engineers. Engineers break down large problems into the smallest possible parts, and tackle each small part one at a time.

This is one of the major skills for web development!

Here's some steps to follow to help get you in this mindset:

1. Familiarize yourself with the [docs](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI)
	- Specifically, we will be using the [search endpoint](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI#search-endpoint)
		- Also note the ever-important API Key situation (We will be using the [Public Beta API key](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI#public-beta-key))

2. Test the API out in your browser!
	- Go to http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=cats&api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC. This is the API request for the search term `cats`.
	- What do you see? It's a JSON Object!

3. Clone this project. We first want to write jQuery that returns and `console.log()`s that same object we saw when we opened the API in our browser. BUT HOW DO I AJAX!!??
	- Look at this example of an `$.ajax` request:
	```js
	$.ajax({

		// What kind of request
		method: "GET",

		// The URL for the request
		url: "http://api.api.com/search",

		// The data to send aka query parameters
		data: $("form").serialize(),

		// Code to run if the request succeeds;
		// the response is passed to the function
		success: onSuccess,

		// Code to run if the request fails; the raw request and
		// status codes are passed to the function
		error: onError
	});

	function onSuccess(json) {
		$("div").append("<h1>"+json.title+"</h1>");
	}

	function onError(xhr, status, errorThrown) {
		alert("Sorry, there was a problem!");
		console.log("Error: " + errorThrown);
		console.log("Status: " + status);
		console.dir(xhr);
	}
	```
	- How would you repurpose this to GET the data you want from the URL you want.
		- What is your base API url? What are the query parameters?
		- HINT: you need to `serialize()` your form data.

4. Start playing in your scripts/app.js file.
	- Your first step is to make an Ajax call fire when your page loads. Don't try to do everything at once! First try to log the data to the console. Then work on logging specific data you want. What do you need to get the gifs to actually load on the page? There is a bunch of stuff in this data object and you need to figure out what you need.
	- Once you narrowed that down, THEN you want to build functions that generate HTML Strings and `append()` them to the page.
	- First log those strings to the console, and make sure they look like you think they should. THEN append them into the DOM!

5. Can you bonus? Get the input box to make a different AJAX call to the search URL.
	- Does a search box button have a default action? What do we want do with that?
	- Are we just appending more and more gifs to the dom? Do we need to clear previous gifs before loading more?
	- OMG are you making a one page app using AJAX like a boss?

6. Can you super bonus? Add a `Load More` button that, when clicked, appends 25 more gifs to the bottom of the page.
	- You will need to make use of the `offset` query parameter. See [Search Endpoint](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI#search-endpoint) section for more information.

# Mongoose

### Warmup

Fill in the [express project file structure organizer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XKZSGX5qusRB6bXg8lk2Q7NNnA4lJjoIbuz1ZxGfSDE/edit?usp=sharing) (printed sheet).  For each file or directory on the sheet, list:
- a short summary of the purpose of the file or directory
- whether the file or directory is most related to the client, the server, or the database

You won't know what some of the database files do yet, but that's okay. Make notes about them as you see them come up today.

[Here's a link to a filled-in sheet where you can add comments if you'd like.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f8wADduS5Xq8rlOPmonIY2I1GdWULJA1FrFN0M1kAyE/edit?usp=sharing)

### Why is this important?
<!-- framing the "why" in big-picture/real world examples -->
*This workshop is important because:*

We want user data that lasts (or "persists") even when we make changes to the code on our servers! Databases will give us more power to store persistent data even when servers restart.

There are *many* kinds of databases that are optimized for different things.  We'll start with MongoDB. MongoDB is a widely-used noSQL database, and using it will help you understand how many databases work.

We'll also take advantage of Mongoose, a library that makes it easier to use MongoDB with express projects.


### What are the objectives?
<!-- specific/measurable goal for students to achieve -->
*After this workshop, developers will be able to:*

- Describe the relationship between schemas and models in Mongoose.
- Create Mongoose model instances.
- Using Mongoose, integrate a MongoDB database with an Express project.


### Where should we be now?
<!-- call out the skills that are prerequisites -->
*Before this workshop, developers should already be able to:*

- Use Express to configure a server's responses to various HTTP verbs on various routes.
- access data that comes in on a request from the client-side (`req.body` or `req.params`).

## MongoDB and Mongoose

![tumblr_nbhme6bafu1s02vreo1_500](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4304660/16811532/b08865a8-48dd-11e6-9474-c114b2e8a00d.gif)

`MongoDB` is a no-SQL database. It is responsible for storing data in containers and making sure that the data is safe and organized. MongoDB stores data in BSON, "a binary JSON format", and it has a JavaScript API. We'll see SQL databases later that store data in a format more like an Excel spreadsheet.

`Mongoose` is a library or "wrapper" that gives us a bunch of convenience methods for working with MongoDB records (kind of like jQuery's convenience methods for manipulating the DOM). Generally we will not be interacting _directly_ with MongoDB, instead we'll be working through `mongoose`.


## SQL vs. no-SQL
Wondering what makes noSQL different from SQL? (we'll talk more about this later)

There are two main categories of databases: relational (SQL) databases, and non-relational (no-SQL) databases. Mongo is a no-SQL database that stores entries in a JSON-like format.

Since MongoDB is the first database we've worked with it's hard for us to discuss the tradeoffs between SQL/no-SQL. But here's a great analogy from StackOverflow:

> "NoSQL databases store information like you would recipes in a book. When you want to know how to make a cake, you go to that recipe, and all of the information about how to make that cake (ingredients, preparation, mixing, baking, finishing, etc.) are all on that one page.
>
> SQL is like shopping for the ingredients for the recipe. In order to get all of your ingredients into your cart, you have to go to many different aisles to get each ingredient. When you are done shopping, your grocery cart will be full of all the ingredients you had to run around and collect.
>
> Wouldn’t it be nicer if there was a store that was organized by recipe, so you could go to one place in the store and grab everything you need from that one spot? Granted you’ll find ingredients like eggs in 50 different places, so there’s a bit of overhead when stocking the shelves, but from a consumer standpoint it would be much easier/faster to find what they're looking for."

-<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14428069/sql-and-nosql-analogy-for-the-non-technical/14428221#14428221" target="_blank">mgoffin, Jan 20 '13 at 19:15</a>




## Schemas and Models

Mongoose presents us with two key concepts for how we create and store data in our MongoDB database.

**[Schema](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html)**: A Schema is a diagram or blueprint for what every object in the noSQL database will contain. It does not include any methods, just placeholders for what data you will eventually store. Here's an example of a simple Address Book mongoose schema:

```js
const ContactSchema = new Schema({
    firstName: String,
    lastName: String,
    address: String,
    phoneNumber: Number,
    email: String,
    professionalContact: Boolean
});
```

With the above Schema, we can expect that all of our Address Book entries would have a first name, last name, address, and email address in the form of Strings. We can count on the phoneNumber to always be accepted, stored, and returned as a number. Lastly, the boolean value of Professional Contact will always be a true or false. A Schema has no functionality. It simply defines the shape of the data that we will expect when we work with contacts.

**[Model](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html)**: A mongoose model is compiled from a Schema. It takes in the structure and shape of a Schema and adds the capacity to perform actions such as reading, saving, updating, etc. The Schema is just an inert mould to make sure that the models will hold the data consistently. A model is actually capable of creating new entries in a database and retrieving data from the database. Here's how you'd make a Contact model out of our Contact Schema:

```js
const Contact = mongoose.model('Contact', ContactSchema);
```

> In mongoose, a schema represents the structure of a particular document, either completely or just a portion of the document. It's a way to express expected properties and values as well as constraints and indicies. A model defines a programming interface for interacting with the database (read, insert, update, etc). So a schema answers "what will the data in this collection look like?" and a model provides functionality like "Are there any records matching this query?" or "Add a new document to the collection".

> *[Source: Peter Lyons on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22950282/mongoose-schema-vs-model/22950402#22950402)*

![image](https://i.chzbgr.com/full/7986468352/hE55E1B66/)

Factory metaphor: Imagine a factory that has a mold for making rubber ducks. The mold would be the Schema. The machine that is capable of putting the different colored plastic into the mold, pressing it, and delivering a new toy to the world would be the model. The toy itself would be the data that would now be stored in your database.

## MongoDB & Mongoose setup

Before we get Mongoose and MongoDB running, let's do a quick activity and set up our todo app.

1. Make a project directory and `server.js`:

  ```bash
  mkdir todo_app
  cd todo_app
  touch server.js
  ```

2. Use `npm init` to create a `package.json`:

  ```bash
  npm init
  ```

3. Install Express and open the project directory in your text editor:

  ```bash
  npm install express

  code .
  ```

4. Now, assuming you already have MongoDB installed (you did this at installfest), to get started using mongoose in a project, we have to install it to add it to a project's `package.json`:

  ```bash
    npm i mongoose
  ```

5. Next we need to `require` Mongoose in our project and `connect` to the MongoDB service (it could be local or hosted). We can do this in `server.js`, or separate the code a little more by using a `models` directory and connecting everything in `models/index.js`.

  ```js
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/todo-app', { useNewUrlParser: true } );
  ```


> **What's a connection string?**
> The <code>'mongodb://localhost/todo-app'</code> is a database URL.  Here, it's a local database named <code>todo-app</code>. You can name the system whatever you like and it will be created as soon as you save some data to it. The second argument, `{ useNewUrlParser: true } ` is in preparation for a new method for passing the mongodb server location to the mongoose connection method. 

<br>

6. Finally, we need to run the MongodDB service. Generally you will want it open in a separate tab, running in the background.

  ```bash
    mongod
  ```

> Note: If you already have an instance of MongoDB running, you'll get an error at this step. If that's the case, you can move on to the next step, since MongoDB is already running!

Running your MongoDB service is a lot like running your Express Server!


## Todo App Integration
Once you've finished the above steps, here's how you would set up an Express application with a "Todo" model (so we can start CRUDing todos!). Look in the directory `starter-code` for a starting point.

1. We'll need a `Todo` model, which we will set up in a file called `todo.js`....

2. In your model file (e.g. `todo.js`), create the model **schema**, use it to make a **model**, and export the model so that you can require it in other parts of your app.


```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose'),
    Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const TodoSchema = new Schema({
    task: String,
    description: String
});

const Todo = mongoose.model('Todo', TodoSchema);

module.exports = Todo;
```
<br>


3. In `models/index.js`, require your model.

```js
// models/index.js
// require runs the code from the given file and returns its exports
const Todo = require('./todo');
```
<br>


4. Next in `models/index.js`, export the new model.

```js
// models/index.js
// require runs the code from the given file and returns its exports
const Todo = require('./todo');
// NEW LINE:
exports.Todo = Todo;

```

This will allow us to use the `Todo` model in `server.js`.
<br>



#### Database IDs and data types

Most databases also require that we specify the data type for each attribute.  In mongoose we can use data types from JavaScript, such as String, Number, and Array. Here's a list of all the [available data-types](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html) in mongoose.

Let's look at this example from before.

```js
// models/todo.js
const TodoSchema = new Schema({
    task: String,
    description: String
});
```

> In the above, note how we've assigned **String** as the data types for this Schema.

Once the model object is exported from its individual file, you'll want to `require` it to use it in another file.

Here's a slightly more complex example using the structure with a `models/index.js` file to group together all the models:

```js
  // models/index.js
  const TodoModel = require('./models/todo');
  module.exports = {
    Todo: TodoModel
  }
```
... and in `server.js`:
```js
  // server.js
  const db = require(`./models`); // grab the export object from models/index.js
  // now db.Todo stores the Todo model from the models/todo file
```


### Using the Model

Instead of setting up a full server, we'll use a simple seed file to experiment with some Mongoose methods.

1. Make sure `mongod` is running in a tab of Terminal.

2. Create a file named `seed.js` and make sure to require our models folder at the top.

Now in the `seed.js` file, try making a single instance of a todo with the code below:

```js
const db = require('./models');

const newTodo = {
    task: "learn mongoose",
    description: "keep referring to lessons"
}

db.Todo.create(newTodo, (err, savedTodo) => {
    if(err){
        return console.log(err);
    }
    console.log(`saved new todo: ${savedTodo}`);
});
```
!!!!**** at this step run seed file!!! **** !!!!
> node seed.js

The above logs to the terminal the `savedTodo` success object:

```bash
saved new todo: { _id: 5c6316b5f6e07b4b3c3f1efa,
  task: 'learn mongoose',
  description: 'keep referring to lessons',
  __v: 0 }

```

> Note: Every model instance that we store in the database is assigned an ID. In MongoDB, IDs have a key of `_id` and a value that is a 24-character string.  We can use this ID later to look up a particular record. Later on we'll look at how we can use those IDs can help us form relationships in the database.

## CRUD Operations with Mongoose

Until now, when we wanted to access or manipulate stored data on our server, we worked with an array. We were sending around the whole array, finding single objects in an array, adding objects to an array, and deleting elements from an array.

At what API route did we complete each of the above?
    <ul>
        <li>
            sending along the whole array: GET /todos
        </li>
        <li>
            finding single objects in an array: GET /todos/:id
        </li>
        <li>
            adding objects to an array: POST /todos
        </li>
        <li>
            deleting elements from an array: DELETE /todos/:id
        </li>
    </ul>
<br>



Luckily, Mongoose provides methods to access the database data which will help us accomplish these tasks.

### Get all todos: `.find()`

We can use <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.find">.find()</a> to get all documents in the collection.


```js
// get all todos
app.get('/api/todos', (req, res) => {
// find all todos in db
    db.Todo.find({}, (err, allTodos) => {
        if(err) { return console.log(err) }
        res.json(allTodos)
    });
});
```

> Note: We can also use `.find()` to get a specific set of documents in the collection (rather than ALL documents) by setting conditions. Read more <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.find"  target="_blank">in the docs</a>.

<br>


### Create new todo: `.create()`

With this method we can pass in an object literal of the data we want to convert into a database object. We can pull this data from the request body.

```js
// create new todo
app.post('/api/todos', (req, res) => {
    // create a temp variable with form data (`req.body`)
    let newTodo = req.body;

    // create newtodo based on model Todo in db
    db.Todo.create(newTodo, (err, savedTodo) => {
        if(err) { return console.log(err) }
        res.json(savedTodo);
    });
});
```
<br>

>> go to insomnia and post task and description, unsder url encoded
example of return todo
{
  "_id": "5c847fd397759529f67e10af",
  "task": "hello funyy meessage 1",
  "description": "happ7 birthda6!",
  "__v": 0
}


### Get one todo: `.findOne()`

We can use <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#query_Query-findOne">.findOne()</a> to return the first document in the collection that matches certain criteria. In this case, we're looking for a todo that has a certain `_id`.


```js
// get one todo
app.get('/api/todos/:id', (req, res) => {
    // get todo id from url params (`req.params`)
    let todoId = req.params.id;

    // find todo in db by id
    db.Todo.findOne({ _id: todoId }, (err, foundTodo) => {
        if(err) { return console.log(err) }
        res.json(foundTodo);
    });
});
```

> Note: The <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.findById" target="_blank">.findById()</a> method will also return a single document matching a specified id field.

<br>


### Update todo: `.findOneAndUpdate()`

We can call `findOneAndUpdate` to find the document with a known `_id`. After updating the document, we will receive an updated document. That's the `{new: true}` option you see as the third argument.

```js
// update todo
app.put('/api/todos/:id', function(req, res) {
    // get todo id from url params (`req.params`)
    let todoId = req.params.id;
    // get update body from req.body
    let updateBody = req.body;

    // find and update the todos's attributes
    db.Todo.findOneAndUpdate(
        { _id: todoId }, // search condition
        updateBody, // new content you want to update
        {new:true}, // you want to receive the new object
        (err, updatedTodo) => { // callback
        if(err) { return console.log(err) }
        res.json(updatedTodo);
    });
});
```
<br>


### Delete todo: `.deleteOne()`

The <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.deleteOne" target="_blank">.deleteOne()</a> method takes care of finding the document with a certain `_id` and removing it from the database.


```js
// delete todo
app.delete('/api/todos/:id', (req, res) => {
    // get todo id from url params (`req.params`)
    let todoId = req.params.id;

    // find todo in db by id and delete
    db.Todo.deleteOne(
        { _id: todoId },
        (err, deletedTodo) => {
            if(err) { return console.log(err) }
            res.json(deletedTodo);
    });
});
```

# Sprint 1 - mongoDB & mongoose

## 0. Set up your app

1. Fork and clone this repository.

2. Make a branch for your work using the command `git checkout -b my-work-sprint-1`. This branch will house the work that you have done on sprint 1.

## 1. You awake inside a new app and look around.

1. Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with your surroundings and navigate the file structure of this app.  You should see a few routes listed in `server.js`; a basic front-end using them, a few files in public including your front-end JavaScript.  
  > "Hmm", you think to yourself, "this app seems to be a books app."

2. Open up your browser and startup the server.  Take a look at the books on the front-end.
  > You didn't forget to `npm install` did you?

## 2. OK server.js, let's see what you've got?!

1. Open up `server.js` and take a look at the hard-coded books data.  You should see an array of book objects in there called `books`.

2. You should also already see that there are routes to create (POST) new books, get a list of books (GET index), get a single book (GET show) and edit (PUT) and delete (DELETE) books.  -- Notice they're all manipulating the `books` array.  

## 3. Outgrowing Arrays as a datastore.

Arrays are no longer adequate as a data-store.  They lose their data whenever the server is shut down, they don't support backups unless you copy the file, and new elements never get saved in the file.  Plus, all the cool kids are using databases.

Let's replace that array with a database.  We'll create a booksSchema and Books model.  

First off let's setup mongo and mongoose.  

1. Install mongoose into this repo's package.json: `npm install --save mongoose`
2. Create a new file `models/book.js`. We'll create a schema and model for books in this file!

3. Our books will have the following attributes:
  * title
  * author
  * image (use a string for this)
  * releaseDate

  Let's create a schema using these properties.  I'll get you started:

  ```js
  // book.js
  var mongoose = require('mongoose');
  var Schema = mongoose.Schema;

  var BookSchema = new Schema({
       title: String,
      // you should fill the rest of this in
   });
  ```

4. Next let's create the `Book` model from the schema.  
  ```js
  // book.js
  var Book = mongoose.model('Book', BookSchema);
  ```

5. Finally we'll need to export Book from this **module** (that's this file).  You can export it at the very end of the file by doing:
  ```js
  // book.js
  var Book = mongoose.model('Book', BookSchema);

  module.exports = Book;
  ```

## 4. Review: what are modules ?

1. We've already provided a `models/index.js` for you to use.  Examine it to see that it already:
  - requires mongoose  
  - connects to a local book-app database URI  

2. `index.js` will import each model and export an object called `exports` with keys representing each of our models.  That way we can `require` the entire directory and get all of our models!  Go ahead and import and export your `Book` model in `index.js`.

  ```js
  // models/index.js
  module.exports.Book = require("./book.js");
  ```

3. Now if someone were to `require('./models')` they'd gain access to this book database model.

Let's see what this could look like with more models involved. Don't add these extra modules Here's a module example to demonstrate this:


      ├── models
      │   ├── index.js
      │   ├── book.js
      │   ├── author.js
      │   ├── publisher.js


Inside `index.js` we require each of the other files and export it as one object:

```javascript
// models/index.js
var mongoose = require("mongoose");
// the mongoose.connect line will only happen once in your code for each project
mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost/book-app");   

module.exports = {
  Book: require('./book.js'),
  Author: require('./author.js'),
  Publisher: require('./publisher.js')
};
```

In the end this means that when you require `./models` in `server.js` you get back an object like
        `{ Book: Model, Author: Model, Publisher: Model }`



## 5. Verifying that this is working

1. Take a quick look in `seed.js`.  You should see that it does a `require('./models');` and then later uses `db.Book.create` to load some data into the database.  (You might also notice that it tries to clear the `book-app` database first by deleting all the records.)

**What's a seed-file, you ask?**
> A seed file is a file used to load pre-made data into our database.  It lets us start up our app without having to key in starter data each time.

2. Try running `node seed.js` in your terminal. If you're not seeing `created X books`, then something might be going wrong in your `book.js` file.  

  Here's an example of what your `book.js` could look like:

  ```js
  // entire book.js so far
  var mongoose = require('mongoose');

  var BookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    title: String,
    author: String,
    image: String,
    release_date: String
  });

  var Book = mongoose.model('Book', BookSchema);

  module.exports = Book;
  ```

3. You can use the Mongo shell to check what's now in your database, or start interacting with it through the server files.  If you got an error message above, FIX IT BEFORE YOU MOVE ON.  If you're stuck, ask for help.

<details>
  <summary>Getting deprecation warnings while running our seed file?</summary>
  <br>
  When running our seed file you may see a deprecation warnings in your terminal. They might look something like this:
  
  ```bash
    (node:51637) DeprecationWarning: current URL string parser is deprecated, 
    and will be removed in a future version. To use the new parser, pass option 
    { useNewUrlParser: true } to MongoClient.connect.
  ```

  These look and sound a lot like errors but they're not really that scary. A warning isn't going to stop our code from functioning but it's probably a good idea to take a look at what it says and fix it some time in the future. Strictly speaking, a 'DeprecationWarning' is here to let us know of some aspect of our code that is going to be removed in a future version of some technology we're working with. In this case the warning pertains to a URL Parser in Mongoose. Here's how we fix the warning in the example above:

```bash
  mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost/book-app", { useNewUrlParser: true });
```

  Fixes for other warnings will look similar to the above.

</details>

## 6. Connecting the database to the server

Next we'll start to use our new model in `server.js`.

1. Open `server.js`.  

2. Add the correct `require` statement to `server.js` to import your models module:  `var db = require('./models')`.  This should go near the top as part of the "SETUP and CONFIGURATION".

3. Delete the hard-coded books array.  We'll start to replace each route with the correct code to use the database instead.  From now on, when we want to get to a book, we'll use mongoose methods and access `db.Books`.

4. Find the books index route and replace it with the following code:

  ```js
  // server.js
  app.get('/api/books', function (req, res) {
    // send all books as JSON response
    db.Book.find(function(err, books){
      if (err) {
        console.log("index error: " + err);
        res.sendStatus(500);
      }
      res.json(books);
    });
  });
  ```

5. Restart your server. Debug any error messages you see.

6. If you've successfully seeded your database and debugged your code, you should see all the books from `seed.js` when you refresh the page.


## 7. Add Remaining CRUD Methods

On your own, use mongoose CRUD methods to refactor the other `/api/books*` routes to get data from your database.

Make sure you look back to the notes or the Mongoose documentation for info on important methods like:

* `findById`
* `deleteOne`
* `findOneAndUpdate`

1) go to Github create a new repo using ui with no readme.md file
2) Open Terminal.

Change the current working directory to your local project.

Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
> git init
Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.
> git add .
# Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.
Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.
> git commit -m "First commit"
# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.
At the top of your GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, click  to copy the remote repository URL.

Copy remote repository URL field
In Terminal, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.

> git remote add origin https://github.com/heggy231/mongoose-todo-app.git
# Sets the new remote
> git remote -v
# Verifies the new remote URL
Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.

> git push -u origin master
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin
> git status 
# Confirm to see "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

// separate the code a little more by using a models directory and connecting everything in models/index.js.
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
// In models/index.js, require your model. 
// require runs the code from the given file and returns its exports
//  remember I created model model/todo.js I am inside same folder

### express-personal-api: deploy to heroku
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/express-personal-api/edit/master/README.md
# <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7833470/10423298/ea833a68-7079-11e5-84f8-0a925ab96893.png" width="60"> Personal API

It's time to have some fun and play with the technologies you've learned in the past week. Your goal is to build a API about yourself. Your API will incorporate:
* Well-documented **JSON API** Endpoints
* A full set of **REST-ful Routes** (GET, POST, UPDATE, DELETE)
* At least one **CRUD-able resource** (Create, Read, Update, Destroy)
* and an `/api/profile` endpoint with some basic **details about you**

Finally, you will **consume your API** using AJAX and **render the results** to the page using jQuery.

Please fork & clone this repo to get started.

## Part 0. Deploy to Heroku
Before we start coding, our first goal together is to configure our application so that it can be deployed to Heroku (a web application host).

Follow the instructions here: [Deploying Express Apps to Heroku](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-45/how-to-heroku/blob/master/README.md)

As you continue to work on this project, you'll need to remember to push your changes to heroku (just like you would with github!):

```bash
# git add . -A
# git commit -m "detailed description of what I changed"
git push heroku master
heroku open
```

It's common for code to break "in production" (broken links, different environment, missing dependenies...), even if it worked in development, so do your best to debug! Let us know if you get stuck.

## Part 1. Personal API
Now that we're deployed, it's time to start coding your "personal" api!

#### Minimum Requirements

- **Documented API Endpoints**

    - You must document your API endpoints. We really want to know *how* to use your API! And for starters, we need to know what endpoints exist! (Do this step first! _Plan plan plan!_)
    - One cool way to do this is to create an endpoint at `/api` that describes all the available endpoints. We've set you up with an example in `server.js`. Make sure to update it to fill it in with your own information!
        + Here's a good example student `/api` endpoint:
         <img width="500" alt="example api documentation" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1489337/22841538/dc0b7f26-ef86-11e6-9a56-013bbe51792a.png">

        + See the [Open API Initiative](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#paths-object-example) for what this looks like in practice.
- **A Profile Endpoint** (`/api/profile`) that responds with *hard-coded* data:

    + `name` - a string
    + `githubUsername` - a string
    + `githubLink` - a url to your github profile
    + `githubProfileImage` - the url of your github profile image
    + `personalSiteLink` - a link to your personal site.
    + `currentCity`
    + `pets` - an array of your pets
        + e.g. `[{name: "foo", type: "Cat", breed: "Siamese"}, {name: "bar", type: "Dog", breed: "Dalmation"}]`
        + if you do not have any pets, please get creative, or use hobbies instead
    + Please hardcode it! It would be seriously overkill to save a single profile to the database.
- **At least one resource (mongoose model)** that you can _*CRUD*_ using _*RESTful Routes*_
    - That means endpoints for `index`, `show`, `create` `update`, `delete`!
    - Here are some ideas:
        * **RECOMMENDED:** `projects` that you have built for this class
            - `_id`, name, description, githubRepoUrl, deployedUrl, screenshot
        * `places` that you've lived or that are important to you
            - `_id`, description, town, state, country, years, gps: {lat, lon}, photo
        * `destinations` you've visited, or `vacations` you're planning
            - `_id`, country, date, duration, photo
        * `books` you've read or love
            - `_id`, title, author, image, releaseDate, characters
        * `movies` or `shows` you like
            - `_id`, title, season, director
        * `portfolioProjects` or `lyrics` you've written
            - `_id`, title, body, date
        * Wish list (e.g. `gifts` or `wishes`)
            - `_id`, description, price, amazonLink

All API Endpoints must return JSON.

<!--- You will be able to see if your API is up and running because [this api aggregator](https://api-aggregator.herokuapp.com/) will be able to consume your data. Check back on it to see if it's working for your code! Note: This won't be set up until you send your instructors the name of your Heroku app! --->

> **Pro-Tip**: One good strategy is to add the database *last*. Start with your api routes and some hard-coded data. Make sure it's working the way you want before tackling the database layer!

#### API Stretch Goals
* Profile info stretch goals
    * Add a `daysOld` field that calculates how many days old you are.
    * Add an `isAwake` field that's only `true` between 8am and 10pm!
* CRUD resource stretch goals
    * Use query parameters to filter results from one of your CRUD endpoints:
        - e.g. `?limit=2` only return two results
    * Create a `/search` endpoint
        - e.g. `?q=mad+men` only returns tv shows with that in the title
        - e.g. `?type=romance` only returns romance novels

#### Examples
An example API for 'Jon Snow' might have endpoints like:

    JSON API Endpoint           Response JSON
    =============               =============
    GET /api/profile            {
                                  name: "Jon Snow",
                                  githubLink: "http://github.com/u-know-nothing-jon-snow",
                                  currentCity: "The Wall",
                                  isAwake: false,
                                  familyMembers: [
                                    { name: 'Arya Stark', relationship: 'sister' },
                                    { name: 'Bran Stark', relationship: 'brother' }
                                  ]
                                }

    GET /api/projects           [
                                 {
                                    \_id: 2,
                                    name: 'Defeat the wildlings',
                                    type: 'quest',
                                    opponents: [ 'Mance Rayder', 'Lord of Bones'],
                                    status: 'resolved'
                                 },
                                 {
                                    \_id: 3,
                                    name: 'Save the wildlings',
                                    type: 'campaign',
                                    opponents: ['the Night Watch', 'the Others'],
                                    status: 'pending'
                                 }
                                ]

    GET /api/projects?limit=1   [ { \_id: 2, name:'Defeat...' } ]

    GET /api/projects?status=pending
                                [ { \_id: 3, name:'Save...' } ]                                
    GET /api/projects/2         { \_id: 2, name:'Defeat...' }

    POST /api/projects          etc
    PUT /api/projects/2         etc
    DELETE /api/projects/2      etc

Make sure to spend time planning this part out!

## Bonus: Personal Dashboard

Consume the Personal API you just created, and use it to build your own personal dashboard.

* Create an `index.html` **homepage** that's linked to your main JavaScript and CSS files.
* Use **jQuery** and **AJAX** to consume your Personal API.

* Use **Template Strings** and **Array Iteration** to render data to the page.

* Display **at least one image/gif** that you retrieved from your Personal API.
* Create **at least one form**, so you can CRUD at least one of your resources.
* Get rid of that ugly blue background. Style it up!

If the initializer is omitted (by just calling npm init), init will fall back to legacy init behavior. It will ask you a bunch of questions, and then write a package.json for you. It will attempt to make reasonable guesses based on existing fields, dependencies, and options selected. It is strictly additive, so it will keep any fields and values that were already set. You can also use -y/--yes to skip the questionnaire altogether. If you pass --scope, it will create a scoped package.

## Opening (5 mins)
- Review Learning Objectives.
- Preview the lab that students will be working on in this class.

In this lesson, we'll dig into how we can request data from an external API using AJAX.

What is an API and why are they useful? Watch this short [video](https://generalassembly.wistia.com/medias/ntnzqxrij7) to find out.


***

<a name="intro-to-apis"></a>
## Intro to APIs (10 mins)

Taken from HowStuffWorks.com:

"An application-programming interface (API) is a set of programming instructions and standards for accessing a Web-based software application or Web tool. A software company releases its API to the public so that other software developers can design products that are powered by its service... [it] is a software-to-software interface, not a user interface. With APIs, applications talk to each other without any user knowledge or intervention."

As you saw in the video, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) can be used to communicate between programs.

#### When do we want to use an API?

When do we want to use an API?

Let's explore a few examples where it would be useful to pull data from an external API.

##### Maps

We may want to incorporate an interactive map into our website, but it would take a lot of time and manpower to do it ourselves.

Instead, we can use the Google Maps API to integrate the functionality of Google Maps into our site.


Even large companies such as WhatsApp and Airbnb use the Google Maps API.


<img src="assets/sjC5K4ZzwF0AAAAASUVORK5CYII_.png">


Why bother recreating a map from scratch when we can use a platform that contains a variety of features and is maintained by a team of expert developers?

##### Social Media Integration

If we want to integrate social media sharing into our site, we can use the Twitter or Facebook APIs. This allows our users to log in with their existing social media accounts and saves us from having to create our own social media platform.

##### Payment System

If we want to integrate a secure payment system into our site, we can make use of a payment API, such as PayPal.


<img src ="assets/urban.png">


This allows our customers to make payments using the trusted accounts they've already set up.



#### What can an API do?

The first thing we need to find out when looking at an API is _what_ the API can do.

Every API can be used to complete different tasks. When we want to solve a particular problem, we need to research what different APIs can do so that we pick the right tool for the job.


- The Facebook and Twitter APIs allow us to access and update profiles, as well as create status updates.
- The Spotify API allows us to find another user's playlists, or add and remove tracks from a playlist we create on our own.


How do we find out what an API can do?

Easy: We check out its documentation.


#### Turn and Talk

Spend two minutes discussing the following with a partner:

Describe APIs. List a few examples where it would be helpful to use an external API.


***

<a name="intro-to-ajax"></a>
## Intro to AJAX

Later in this lesson, we'll take a look at some examples of how we can make API calls.

Before we start using these APIs, let's take a step back and look at AJAX: A group of technologies we can use to load data into different parts of our page.

#### What is AJAX?

What is AJAX?

AJAX stands for **A**synchronous **Ja**vaScript and **X**ML.

**Asynchronous** is a term used to describe a non-blocking process. This means that, when we're making updates, we can load data into part of a page without having the whole page refresh.

AJAX is used all over the web. You've probably encountered it before, even if you weren't aware of it.

- For example, think of a live search that loads results as you type. With AJAX, the whole page doesn't refresh every time you type a character — only the results are updated.

	<img src="assets/jsc-U8L1-amazon-cart.gif">

- Or if you type a username into a web form, you may see a notification that the username has already been taken.

<img src="assets/jsc_U8L1_ajax-login.gif">

#### How does AJAX work?

1. First, the browser requests data from a server.
2. The server then responds with data, often in HTML or JSON format.
3. When the server has finished responding, the browser will fire an event. This event triggers a function that processes the data and adds it to the page.

This allows us to change the parts of the page that need to be updated — without affecting the entire page.


#### Advantages

- __Faster__ - This is the most obvious reason for using AJAX on your front-end: AJAX allows easier and quicker interaction between user and website, as pages need not reload for new content to be displayed. The server doesn't have to get data, render HTML, and then spit it out; it just has to get data, and your already-loaded front-end does the rest.

- __Compact__ - With AJAX, several application features can be handled using a single web page. That means we modularize our app into smaller bits, and it becomes easier to work on.

- __Backend Separated from Front-end__ - Applications that use AJAX-heavy front-ends mean developers don't have to work on both sides of the stack at the same time. Some developers can be dedicated to building an API that just serves data, and others can focus on consuming that data and building interfaces.


#### Disadvantages

- __Back and Refresh Buttons are Rendered Useless__ - Since things are loaded dynamically on a page without that page reloading (or more importantly, a URL being changed), clicking the back or refresh buttons won't work the way you're used to. That's actually a pretty big deal: UX designers are very familiar with the fact that users are _accustomed_ to being able to hit back when they need to. Some advanced front-end frameworks have tried to solve this issue with clever workarounds, but that's not always the case and not always accurate.

- __JavaScript Can be Disabled__ - While JavaScript is secure and has been heavily used by websites for a long period of time, a percentage of website surfers prefer to turn JavaScript functionality off in their browser, rendering the AJAX application totally useless. That's not always the best thing to design for, and more often than not, you'll find yourself assuming users have JS on; but it's nonetheless important to know your whole site could be useless in some situations.

- __You Have to Consider the UX Even More__ - While UX is crucial for _any_ application, the fact that a page doesn't refresh means you have to be even more considerate of what a user is experiencing. If something in your JavaScript goes wrong, your AJAX breaks, and you don't have failsafes thoughtfully built in, your user might be clicking a button and seeing absolutely nothing happen. Most regular users won't have their consoles open in order to notice any errors.


<a name="making-ajax-requests"></a>
## Making AJAX Requests

Next, let's dig into the `ajax()` method, which we can use to request and send data. This method provides us with granular control by giving us more than 30 settings for managing our request.

Let's take a look at the syntax for the AJAX method:

```js
	$.ajax({ });
```

Then we'll use object literal notation to pass in a settings object as the argument.


Here are some of the settings we can provide:

<img src="assets/08-39-settings_list.svg">

We can provide them in any order, as long as we are using valid object literal notation.


- **method** This will take the value "GET" if we want to request data from a server, and "POST" if we want to send data that updates on a server.

  ```js
  $.ajax({
    	method: "GET"
  });
  ```
- **url** The URL setting defines the page where we'll send the request.
  ```js
  $.ajax({
	    method: "GET",
	    url: "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q="
  });
  ```

- **data** Next, we have the data setting, which allows you to send additional data to the server along with the request.

  ```js
  $.ajax({
    	method: "GET",
    	url: "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=",
    	data: {
          id: 123
      }
  });
  ```

- **success** Next, we have the success setting, which runs if the request is successfully completed.
  ```js
  $.ajax({
    method: "GET",
    url: "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=",
    data: {
      id: 123
  },
    success: function( response ) {
      $('#temp').html("The temperature in Detroit is " + response.temp);
    }
  });
  ```

- **error** The error setting will run a function if there is an error with the request.

	```js
	$.ajax({
		method: "GET",
		url: "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=",
		data: {
		  	id: 123
		},
		success: function( response ) {
		  	$('#temp').html("The temperature in Detroit is " + response.temp);
		},
		error: function() {
		  	alert("There was an error getting weather data.");
		}
	});
	```

- **beforeSend** We can use the beforeSend setting to run code before the request is sent.

  ```js
	$.ajax({
		method: 'GET',
		url: 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=',
		data: {
		  id: 123
		},
		success: function( response ) {
		  $('#temp').html('The temperature in Detroit is ' + response.temp);
		},
		error: function() {
		  alert('There was an error getting weather data.');
		},
		beforeSend: function () {
		  $('#page').append('Loading');
		}
	});
  ```

- **complete** And finally, we can use the complete setting to run a function after the request is complete.

  ```js
  $.ajax({
	    method: 'GET',
	    url: 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=',
	    data: {
	      id: 123
	    },
	    success: function( response ) {
	      $('#temp').html('The temperature in Detroit is ' + response.temp);
	    },
	    error: function() {
	      alert('There was an error getting weather data.');
	    },
	    beforeSend: function () {
	      $('#page').append('Loading');
	    },
	    complete: function () {
	      $('#loading').remove();
	    }
  });
  ```

***
<a name="making-api-call"></a>
## Guided Practice - Making an API Call

For our first API call, we'll use the Google Books API.

Starter code for this exercise can be found in [starter\_code/google\_books\_api](starter_code/google_books_api).

We'll create a basic site where users can add books to a reading list by entering their International Standard Book Number (ISBN).

Let's start with a simple HTML form where a user can enter an ISBN, as well as an unordered list where we will add each book the user searches for:

```html
<h1>Search for a book by ISBN</h1>

<form>
	<input type="text" id="isbn" name="isbn" value="" placeholder="Please enter an ISBN">
	<button type="submit">Find Book</button>
</form>

<ul class="books">
</ul>

```

#### URLs

Before taking a look at the JavaScript, let's take a step back and find out how we can access the data for a book using the Google Books API.

To access this information, we'll need a URL where we can find the JSON data for a book that matches an ISBN number.

How does the server know what the request is actually asking? This is the job of the URL, a special path that specifies where a resource can be found on the web.

Let's take a look at the different components of a URL that could be used for an API call:

- **The Protocol:** HTTP — or **H**yper**t**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol — is a system of rules ("protocol") that determines how web pages ("hypertext") are sent ("transfer") from one place to another.

	This is really just a fancy way of saying "the rules of sending something from one place to another."

<img src="assets/08-52-protocol.svg">

- **The Host:** This is the domain name for the site. This request will be sent to a Domain Name Server (DNS), which will look up the IP address and find out where the files for that resource are stored. An IP address is a unique string of numbers that helps us locate the correct server.

<img src="assets/08-53-host.svg">


- **The Port:** Internet hosts have a certain number of ports that offer different services. One port could offer HTTP, another could offer mail routing, and so on. HTTP usually runs on port 80 and HTTPS runs on port 443, but this is not always the case. If the protocol is running on the default port (80 or 443), you don't need to specify a port number. If it is running on a different port, a colon (:) followed by the port number (in this case, 1234) is required to point to that port.


	<img src="assets/08-54-port.svg">

- **The Resource Path:** Where the resource (HTML, JSON, PDF, images, etc.) is located.

<img src="assets/08-55-path.svg">

- **The Query:** We can use queries to "filter" the data we find and retrieve certain results.

<img src="assets/08-56-query.svg">



#### Google Books URL

Now let's break down what the URL that allows us to access information from Google Books looks like:

<img src="assets/08-57-google.svg">



- **The Protocol:** In this case, it will be HTTPS, which is the protocol used for a secure communication over a network.
	<img src="assets/08-58-protocol.svg">
- **The Host:** Google host will be `www.googleapis.com`
	<img src="assets/08-59-host.svg">

- **The Resource Path:** We want to access Version 1 of the books API and find a volume.
<img src="assets/08-60-resource.svg">

- **The Query:** This is how we will look up a particular book.
	<img src="assets/08-61-query.svg">


_This URL will mostly stay the same for each call; only the ISBN at the end will vary:_

<img src="assets/08-62-usbn.svg">

####  Constructing the URL

We can use string concatenation to add the right ISBN to the URL, and then locate information about that book:

`https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:" + isbnUserEntered`

> Paste the below URL into your browser and take a look at the JSON object that is returned.

`https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:0679775439`

Now that you've seen the full JSON response, let's take a look at a stripped-down version of the response showing us the relevant data.

You can see that we have an array named "items." This array contains a JSON object.


```js
{
 "items": [
  {
   "volumeInfo": {
    "title": "The Wind-up Bird Chronicle",
    "description": "Superimposes the collapse of a marriage over the investigation into recovered war memories and a man's search for his own identity",
    "imageLinks": {
     "thumbnail": "http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iTt3WN2U8wwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"
    },
    "previewLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=iTt3WN2U8wwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0679775439&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api"
    }
  }
 ]
}
```

Within that object, there is an object named `"volumeInfo"` that contains information we want to access about the book: a title, description, thumbnail, and preview link.

To access the title in this array, we can use the following syntax:

`response.items[0].volumeInfo.title`

***
<a name="ind-practice"></a>
## Independent Practice - Making an API Call

Okay! Now that we know more about the URL, we'll use that information to make the API call and receive data. Let's dig into the JavaScript.

- Paste the following code in your JS file.
- Assemble a group of three or four and walk through each line of code. Talk about what each line will do.
- Open the site in Chrome and test it out, entering different ISBN numbers into the input field.
	- Try out the following ISBN numbers:
		- 9781439154175
		- 9780307477477
		- 9781596792357
		- 0679775439
- Take a look at your console. We are using a `console.log` statement to log the response that was received from the server. Enter an ISBN, hit the submit button, and take a look at the full response that was returned.

```js

var googleBooksUrl = "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:";

$('form').on('submit', function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();

  var isbn = $('#isbn').val();

  $.ajax({
      method: 'GET',
      url: googleBooksUrl + isbn,
      success: function( response ) {
        console.log(response);
        var bookInfo = response.items[0].volumeInfo;

        var listItemHTML = `<li>
				<h2>${bookInfo.title}</h2>
				<p>${bookInfo.description}</p>
				<img src= ${bookInfo.imageLinks.thumbnail}>
				<a href= ${bookInfo.previewLink }>Preview Book</a>

        $('.books').append(listItemHTML);
      }
  });
});
```

> Note how constructing an HTML fragment for our list item and adding in the data that needs to be displayed using JavaScript gets a bit messy. We can use a templating library, such as Handlebars, to make this process cleaner and keep HTML out of our JS files.

## Reading Documentation

Now that we have some experience working with APIs, we're going to take a step back and learn how to fully understand an API's documentation.

There are no rules governing how to write documentation for an API, so its content is presented differently each time.

While searching for the right API, you'll want to explore the different options that are available to you, and then take a look at each option's documentation.

Try to find documentation that contains detailed setup instructions and discusses workable options. Assets like these will come in handy when implementing your APIs.

Knowing how to quickly find key pieces of information is the most important part of reading API documentation.

In this lesson, we'll take a look at an API that has very clear documentation — [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/api) — and then practice looking through that documentation and making API calls.

#### Guided Practice

If you go to the [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/api) site and scroll down, you'll see a section that says "API Documentation."

<img src="assets/Screen_Shot_2016-07-17_at_6.13.07_PM.png">

#### API Keys


When we click on the "How to Start" link, we are taken to a page that provides us with information on how to get an [API key](http://openweathermap.org/appid).

For security reasons, many APIs require the use of keys.

An API key is like a signature that uniquely identifies a user. This helps APIs keep track of their traffic and monitor any suspicious activity, such as an individual user sending too many requests.

For example, malicious users might try using multiple usernames until they find one that works. Keys can help prevent these kinds of attacks by limiting how many requests one user can make.

OpenWeatherMap's documentation makes it easy for us to obtain an API key. We simply click the "Sign Up" button and create an account, and then you can get an [API key](http://openweathermap.org/appid).

To make an API call, we'll need to add our key to the URL:

```js
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/city?id=524901&APPID={APIKEY}
```


Here's an example provided in the documentation:

<span style="color: orange;">api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/city?id=524901&APPID=<span style="background-color: yellow">1111111111</span></span>

As you can see, all we need to do is append our API key to the end of the URL.

Now let's review the main points you should look for when examining an API's documentation.

*   Do I need an API key?
*   What kind of information is available?
*   What does a request look like? What should the structure of the URL be?
*   What response should I expect to get back?

Once you've answered all of these questions, you're ready to request data.

#### Looking at Documentation

Now that we have our key, let's look back at some of the other information the API documentation can provide.

Find a partner and spend a few minutes exploring the documentation. See what different types of data we can get from the API.

<a name="network-tab"></a>
## HTTP and Chrome's Network Tab

Now let's dive into the underlying communication layer responsible for transporting our API calls: HTTP.

Having a good grasp on HTTP and the request-and-response cycle is crucial when we want to create, read, update, or delete data.

#### What is HTTP?

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a protocol (a system of rules) that determines how web pages ("HyperText") are sent ("transferred") from one place to another.

Among other things, it defines how messages passed between HTTP clients and HTTP servers should be formatted.


As we've seen in previous lessons, the web is a service that works through a combination of clients (which make requests) and servers (which receive requests).

<img src="assets/Slide-21-Client-Server-Model.svg">


Let's see how clients and servers handle the request-and-response process.

1. A client sends an HTTP request to a HTTP server running on a remote machine. The hostname, given in the URL, indicates which server will receive the request.

2. In the last lesson, we saw how the URL tells the server what the request is asking. Here's a refresher on the different elements that make up a URL:

<img src="assets/08-28-url.svg">
3. The HTTP server processes the HTTP request. This may entail passing the request to a web application written in a language such as Ruby, which creates an HTTP response.

4. The response is sent back to the client.

5. The client processes the response.

#### The Network Tab

Next, let's explore some HTTP resources by looking at HTTP requests and responses using the Chrome Inspector.

To view this request-and-response cycle in Chrome, we'll open up Inspector (command + option + 'i', or ctrl + click and select 'Inspect Element') and select the "Network" tab.


In order to see the requests and responses that are sent out when the page first loads, we'll need to refresh the page:



<img src="assets/A7aFmZyTXfq7AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC.png">

You should be able to see a few HTTP requests and responses in the "Network" tab.

For each request, you'll see Name, Method, Status, Type, and Size, along with information about how long it took to get each of these resources.

Most of this information comes from the HTTP request and response.

Some HTTP requests are for CSS, JavaScript, and images referenced by the HTML.


Let's go ahead and type a city and state into a simple form and hit "Get Weather," which will request the current weather data for that city from the OpenWeatherMap API.

<img src="assets/5n5hXjlLZE0AAAAASUVORK5CYII_.png">


When we do this, we can see that the "Network" tab displays our API request:

<img src="assets/08-32-last_line.svg">


In order to inspect this request and its response, we'll click on the name in the far left-hand column and click on the "Headers" tab:


<img src="assets/08-33-headers.svg">


Headers are metadata properties of an HTTP request or response, separate from the body of the message.


<img src="assets/08-33-headers.svg">

#### Request

We can find all kinds of information in the request header, which shows the request that was sent to the server:


```
GET /data/2.5/weather?q=San%20Francisco,CA&appid=02e84210a52ed716535f02989864d080 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.openweathermap.org
Connection: keep-alive
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache
Accept: */*
Origin: null
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, sdch
        Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8
```

Here is the structure for the request:

`[http request method] [URL] [http version] [list of headers]`

#### HTTP Request Methods

The first word in the request line, "GET," is the HTTP request's method.

In the last lesson, we looked at the "GET" method, which is used to retrieve data, and the "POST" method, which is used to send or create data.

Here is a full list of the HTTP request methods available to us:

*   **GET**: Retrieve a resource.
*   **POST**: Create a resource.
*   **PATCH** (_or PUT, but PATCH is recommended_): Update an existing resource.
*   **DELETE**: Delete a resource.
*   **HEAD**: Retrieve the headers for a resource.

Of these, `"GET"` and `"POST"` are the most commonly used.

> What's the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`? `PUT` should be reserved for replacing an existing resource while `PATCH` can be used for updating pieces of an existing resource.

#### Response

When a client sends a request, the server sends back a response. Let's take a look at the response headers that were returned:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: openresty
Date: Mon, 18 Jul 2016 07:25:56 GMT
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 431
Connection: keep-alive
X-Cache-Key: /data/2.5/weather?q=san%20francisco,ca
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
        Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST
```


The standard format for this response is:

`[http version] [status] [reason]  
[list of headers]` `[response body]` `# typically HTML, JSON,` ...


- The HTTP version should be 1.1.

- [Status Codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) have standard meanings; here are a few:

	<img src="assets/08-39-table.svg" width="300px">
- **Response Body:** If we click on the "Response" tab, this is what we'll see:

	<img src="assets/h8rcP8_2FgFogAAAABJRU5ErkJggg__.png">
	The response is a JSON object with the current weather data we requested from the OpenWeatherMap API.

#### Review

The "Network" tab is a helpful resource if your request and responses aren't working correctly.

You can use it to debug, or to take a look at your response if you're not sure what format to expect.


You can also use it to look at the status code to make sure that it is 200, which means request was successful.

Any other status code will help you identify what the error might be.

For example, if you receive a 404, it means that your request was not found.

### deploy Heroku deploy
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/express-personal-api#part-0-deploy-to-heroku
## Part 0. Deploy to Heroku
Before we start coding, our first goal together is to configure our application so that it can be deployed to Heroku (a web application host).

Follow the instructions here: [Deploying Express Apps to Heroku](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-45/how-to-heroku/blob/master/README.md)

As you continue to work on this project, you'll need to remember to push your changes to heroku (just like you would with github!):

```bash
# git add . -A
# git commit -m "detailed description of what I changed"
git push heroku master
heroku open
```

## Getting set up on Heroku with Node + Mongoose

### Before you do anything
1) Stop and commit. Make sure your app is under version control with `git`.  If you're not sure whether your project is under version control yet, you definitely haven't been commiting often enough! But run `git status` to check if your project directory is a repo and `git init` to make it into one if necessary. __Stop and commit your changes.__

2) Sign up for an account with heroku: https://www.heroku.com/

3) Install the heroku toolbelt (if you haven't done so already):

**OSX users:**
<a href="https://cli-assets.heroku.com/branches/stable/heroku-osx.pkg">Click this link to download the ToolBelt for OSX</a>  Run the file and follow the prompts to install.

**Ubuntu users:** Run this command from your terminal:
```bash
wget -O- https://toolbelt.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh
```

Once installed, you can use the heroku command from your command shell.
Log in using the email address and password you used when creating your Heroku account:

```bash
heroku login
# Enter your Heroku credentials.
# Email: zeke@example.com
# Password:
# ...
```

Authenticating is required to allow both the heroku and git commands to operate.

**(NOTE YOUR PROJECT MUST BE A GIT REPO TO CONTINUE.)**.

### Preparing for Heroku Deploy

4) Add a new remote to your project that points to Heroku's servers:

```bash
    heroku create <name-of-your-app-heroku> or <leave it blank and it will name your app for you>
```

5) In your `server.js` file, modify `app.listen` to use `process.env.PORT` (this will be set, dynamically, by Heroku):

```javascript
    app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000)
```

6) Tell heroku to use the mongolab addon. In your terminal, run:

```bash
    heroku addons:create mongolab
```

At this point, the command line will probably ask you to enter a credit card number. Follow the prompt.

> Heroku is a "freemium" service. Be careful! They will charge you if you exceed their data limits -- but our projects are tiny so we don't expect to get a lot of traffic!

7) **Patience...**  If you had to enter in a credit card, you can run `heroku addons` to check/confirm that mongolab was addded. __You may need to wait a few minutes for mogolab to become active.__

8) Update your database connection to point to Heroku's database. Open `models/index.js` and add the following to the `mongoose.connect` method:

```javascript
    mongoose.connect( process.env.MONGODB_URI || "YOUR CURRENT LOCALHOST DB CONNECTION STRING HERE" );
```

Congrats! Your application knows what port to run on, and what database to connect to - you're almost all set up to work in "production" on Heroku's servers!

STOP AND COMMIT!

### Setup `.gitignore` (Recommended)
From inside your project directroy, run:
```bash
touch .gitignore
```

Next, open `.gitignore` in your text editor, and add the following line:
```
node_modules
```

Finally, run the following command to untrack your `node_modules` folder (it's not *your* code, so we don't want to track it!):
```bash
git rm -r --cached node_modules
```

STOP AND COMMIT!

### Confirm your Dependencies

9) Double check your `package.json` to make sure that all your depenedencies are present. If something is missing install it.

For example, here are a bunch of common dependencies (*DO NOT COPY*):  
``` javascript
    {
      "dependencies": {
        "body-parser": "^1.13.3",
        "bower": "^1.5.2",
        "express": "^4.13.3",
        "express-session": "^1.11.3",
        "method-override": "^2.3.5",
        "mongoose": "^4.1.5"
      }
    }
```

If your `package.json` is missing any dependencies, you will need to both `install` and `--save` the package. For example, if you notice that the `mongoose` package is missing from your `package.json` you would need to run:

```bash
    npm install --save mongoose
```

<!-- 
### Add a start script
10) Add a `start` script for your application in your `package.json`:

```javascript
...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "postinstall": "bower install"   // only if you're using Bower
   }
...
```

This is assuming your main application file is called `index.js`. If your main file is called something else, adjust the script to use your file name.

### Add a Procfile
11) Create a `Procfile` so that Heroku knows how to run your application:
    - Make sure you are in your main project directory (the same directory as `index.js`). Then run:  
``` bash
    touch Procfile
    echo "web: npm start" >> Procfile
```
-->

### Deploy! https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-45/how-to-heroku/blob/master/README.md

10) Hold your horses! We've made a lot of changes -- let's STOP AND COMMIT!
``` bash
    git add . -A
    git commit -m "ready for heroku deploy attempt #1"
```

11) Now we can deploy:
``` bash
    git push heroku master
```

If you missed a step just ask for help. Otherwise you should be able to visit your application by saying the following:

```bash
    heroku open
```

12) If you have a seed task, you can run it now (assuming everything else is working):

``` bash
heroku run bash
> node seed.js
```

## Debugging Tips

Here are some helpful commands for debugging your application on Heroku:

#### `heroku logs`
This command lists your most recent application server logs. Helpful for figuring out why your application may be crashing and burning.

#### `heroku run bash`
This command allows you to run terminal _on Heroku's servers_. This is a handy way for us to poke around and run commands on our application (like seeding the database, and checking that everything was installed correctly).

- Mongoose book app 
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/mongoose-book-app/edit/master/docs/sprint1.md
# Sprint 1 - mongoDB & mongoose

## 0. Set up your app

1. Fork and clone this repository.

2. Make a branch for your work using the command `git checkout -b my-work-sprint-1`. This branch will house the work that you have done on sprint 1.

## 1. You awake inside a new app and look around.

1. Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with your surroundings and navigate the file structure of this app.  You should see a few routes listed in `server.js`; a basic front-end using them, a few files in public including your front-end JavaScript.  
  > "Hmm", you think to yourself, "this app seems to be a books app."

2. Open up your browser and startup the server.  Take a look at the books on the front-end.
  > You didn't forget to `npm install` did you?

## 2. OK server.js, let's see what you've got?!

1. Open up `server.js` and take a look at the hard-coded books data.  You should see an array of book objects in there called `books`.

2. You should also already see that there are routes to create (POST) new books, get a list of books (GET index), get a single book (GET show) and edit (PUT) and delete (DELETE) books.  -- Notice they're all manipulating the `books` array.  

## 3. Outgrowing Arrays as a datastore.

Arrays are no longer adequate as a data-store.  They lose their data whenever the server is shut down, they don't support backups unless you copy the file, and new elements never get saved in the file.  Plus, all the cool kids are using databases.

Let's replace that array with a database.  We'll create a booksSchema and Books model.  

First off let's setup mongo and mongoose.  

1. Install mongoose into this repo's package.json: `npm install --save mongoose`
2. Create a new file `models/book.js`. We'll create a schema and model for books in this file!

3. Our books will have the following attributes:
  * title
  * author
  * image (use a string for this)
  * releaseDate

  Let's create a schema using these properties.  I'll get you started:

  ```js
  // book.js
  var mongoose = require('mongoose');
  var Schema = mongoose.Schema;

  var BookSchema = new Schema({
       title: String,
      // you should fill the rest of this in
   });
  ```

4. Next let's create the `Book` model from the schema.  
  ```js
  // book.js
  var Book = mongoose.model('Book', BookSchema);
  ```

5. Finally we'll need to export Book from this **module** (that's this file).  You can export it at the very end of the file by doing:
  ```js
  // book.js
  var Book = mongoose.model('Book', BookSchema);

  module.exports = Book;
  ```

## 4. Review: what are modules ?

1. We've already provided a `models/index.js` for you to use.  Examine it to see that it already:
  - requires mongoose  
  - connects to a local book-app database URI  

2. `index.js` will import each model and export an object called `exports` with keys representing each of our models.  That way we can `require` the entire directory and get all of our models!  Go ahead and import and export your `Book` model in `index.js`.

  ```js
  // models/index.js
  module.exports.Book = require("./book.js");
  ```

3. Now if someone were to `require('./models')` they'd gain access to this book database model.

Let's see what this could look like with more models involved. Don't add these extra modules Here's a module example to demonstrate this:


      ├── models
      │   ├── index.js
      │   ├── book.js
      │   ├── author.js
      │   ├── publisher.js


Inside `index.js` we require each of the other files and export it as one object:

```javascript
// models/index.js
var mongoose = require("mongoose");
// the mongoose.connect line will only happen once in your code for each project
mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost/book-app");   

module.exports = {
  Book: require('./book.js'),
  Author: require('./author.js'),
  Publisher: require('./publisher.js')
};
```

In the end this means that when you require `./models` in `server.js` you get back an object like
        `{ Book: Model, Author: Model, Publisher: Model }`



## 5. Verifying that this is working

1. Take a quick look in `seed.js`.  You should see that it does a `require('./models');` and then later uses `db.Book.create` to load some data into the database.  (You might also notice that it tries to clear the `book-app` database first by deleting all the records.)

**What's a seed-file, you ask?**
> A seed file is a file used to load pre-made data into our database.  It lets us start up our app without having to key in starter data each time.

2. Try running `node seed.js` in your terminal. If you're not seeing `created X books`, then something might be going wrong in your `book.js` file.  

  Here's an example of what your `book.js` could look like:

  ```js
  // entire book.js so far
  var mongoose = require('mongoose');

  var BookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    title: String,
    author: String,
    image: String,
    release_date: String
  });

  var Book = mongoose.model('Book', BookSchema);

  module.exports = Book;
  ```

3. You can use the Mongo shell to check what's now in your database, or start interacting with it through the server files.  If you got an error message above, FIX IT BEFORE YOU MOVE ON.  If you're stuck, ask for help.

<details>
  <summary>Getting deprecation warnings while running our seed file?</summary>
  <br>
  When running our seed file you may see a deprecation warnings in your terminal. They might look something like this:
  
  ```bash
    (node:51637) DeprecationWarning: current URL string parser is deprecated, 
    and will be removed in a future version. To use the new parser, pass option 
    { useNewUrlParser: true } to MongoClient.connect.
  ```

  These look and sound a lot like errors but they're not really that scary. A warning isn't going to stop our code from functioning but it's probably a good idea to take a look at what it says and fix it some time in the future. Strictly speaking, a 'DeprecationWarning' is here to let us know of some aspect of our code that is going to be removed in a future version of some technology we're working with. In this case the warning pertains to a URL Parser in Mongoose. Here's how we fix the warning in the example above:

```bash
  mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost/book-app", { useNewUrlParser: true });
```

  Fixes for other warnings will look similar to the above.

</details>

## 6. Connecting the database to the server

Next we'll start to use our new model in `server.js`.

1. Open `server.js`.  

2. Add the correct `require` statement to `server.js` to import your models module:  `var db = require('./models')`.  This should go near the top as part of the "SETUP and CONFIGURATION".

3. Delete the hard-coded books array.  We'll start to replace each route with the correct code to use the database instead.  From now on, when we want to get to a book, we'll use mongoose methods and access `db.Books`.

4. Find the books index route and replace it with the following code:

  ```js
  // server.js
  app.get('/api/books', function (req, res) {
    // send all books as JSON response
    db.Book.find(function(err, books){
      if (err) {
        console.log("index error: " + err);
        res.sendStatus(500);
      }
      res.json(books);
    });
  });
  ```

5. Restart your server. Debug any error messages you see.

6. If you've successfully seeded your database and debugged your code, you should see all the books from `seed.js` when you refresh the page.


## 7. Add Remaining CRUD Methods

On your own, use mongoose CRUD methods to refactor the other `/api/books*` routes to get data from your database.

Make sure you look back to the notes or the Mongoose documentation for info on important methods like:

* `findById`
* `deleteOne`
* `findOneAndUpdate`

- mongoose book app relationship vs reference
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/mongoose-book-app/blob/master/docs/sprint2.md
# Sprint 2 - relationships & referenced data

## 1. You enter a vast building full of books.

1. **If you have successfully completed all of sprint 1, you should continue working based on your current code.** If not, please checkout the solution branch using `git checkout solution-sprint-1` so that you can start working on this second sprint. (You need to have all the changes in your current branch checked in to checkout a new branch.) At this point, you should have a node app set up to serve data about books and even allow users to add books, change them, and delete them. Look through any code in `server.js` and in the `models` directory that's new to you.

1. Startup the server and open up your browser.  Take a look at the updated front-end.

## 2. More than just a piece of text!

We have authors listed as just a string inside books, but what happens if we want to store more than just an author's name?  Let's create a separate model for authors.  

1. Create a new file `models/author.js`.

1. Authors will get attributes for `name`, `alive`, and `image`.  Create a schema for authors with those three attributes.

  ```js
      
      // models/author.js
      var mongoose = require('mongoose');
      var Schema = mongoose.Schema;

      var AuthorSchema = new Schema({
        name: String,
        // you should fill the rest of this in
      });

  ```



1. Next, create an `Author` model from the schema.  

    ```js
      // models/author.js
      var Author = mongoose.model('Author', AuthorSchema);
    ```




1. Now, export your Author model.

  ```js
  // models/author.js
  module.exports = Author;
  ```


  Now if another file inside the `models` directory used `require('./author.js')`, it would have access to the `Author` model exported here!

1. We exported the `Author` model so it's available elsewhere, but now we need to `require` it in the other file(s) that will use it.  We're grouping all our models in `models/index.js`, so add a line to that file to bring in the new `Author` model.  Also add the `Author` model to the `models/index.js` module exports. If you'd like, you can do both in the same line!

  ```js
  module.exports.Author = require("./author.js");
  ```

  Now since we `require('./models')` in `server.js`, `server.js` automatically gains access to _both_ the `Book` database model _and_ the `Author` database model.  In fact, the object brought in with `require('./models')` will be exactly this:

  ```js
  { "Book": Book,  "Author": Author }
  ```

## 3. Whose book is it anyway?

Now we have a books model and authors has its own model. We want to relate them! Now we'll update books to store an author by reference instead of just storing the name.

Referencing authors is a good choice here because:
* many books might share the same author, and   
* we don't want to have to access every single one of an author's books just to make a change to the author's data. 


1. We'll need to update the book schema. Change the `author` line to store a reference to the author:

  ```js
    var BookSchema = new Schema({
      title: String,
      author: {
        type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: 'Author'
      },
      image: String,
      releaseDate: String
    });
  ```
## 4. Authors, assemble!

1. We have all the tools we need to start making authors.  Add the following data to your `seed.js` file.
<!-- Then add a call to `db.Author.remove` to delete all the old authors, and inside it add a call to `db.Author.create` to create new authors. -->

  ```js
    var authors_list = [
      {
        name: "Harper Lee",
        alive: false
      },
      {
        name: "F Scott Fitzgerald",
        alive: false
      },
      {
        name: "Victor Hugo",
        alive: false
      },
      {
        name: "Jules Verne",
        alive: false
      },
      {
        name: "Sheryl Sandberg",
        alive: true
      },
      {
        name: "Tim Ferriss",
        alive: true
      },
      {
        name: "John Steinbeck",
        alive: false
      },
      {
        name: "William Shakespeare",
        alive: false
      }
    ];

  ```


1. Now we need to edit our `seed.js` file to create books and authors being sure to connect the two together. Remove all the other functions and replace with:

  ```js
    
      db.Author.deleteMany({}, function(err, authors) {
        console.log('removed all authors');
        db.Author.create(authors_list, function(err, authors){
          if (err) {
            console.log(err);
            return;
          }
          console.log('recreated all authors');
          console.log("created", authors.length, "authors");


          db.Book.deleteMany({}, function(err, books){
            console.log('removed all books');
            books_list.forEach(function (bookData) {
              var book = new db.Book({
                title: bookData.title,
                image: bookData.image,
                releaseDate: bookData.releaseDate
              });
              db.Author.findOne({name: bookData.author}, function (err, foundAuthor) {
                console.log('found author ' + foundAuthor.name + ' for book ' + book.title);
                if (err) {
                  console.log(err);
                  return;
                }
                book.author = foundAuthor;
                book.save(function(err, savedBook){
                  if (err) {
                    console.log(err);
                  }
                  console.log('saved ' + savedBook.title + ' by ' + foundAuthor.name);
                });
              });
            });
          });

        });
      });
  ```


1. Run `node seed.js` in your terminal again to re-add the books and add the new authors.

## 5. Reroute! 

Some of our book-related routes won't work anymore since we changed the structure of our data.

1. Now on to `server.js`. Try to change over your routes to use the new structure of books and authors. If you get stuck, here's how to change over a few routes:

  ```js
      // get all books
      app.get('/api/books', function (req, res) {
        // send all books as JSON response
        db.Book.find()
          // populate fills in the author id with all the author data
          .populate('author')
          .exec(function(err, books){
            if (err) { console.log("index error: " + err); }
            res.json(books);
          });
      });

      // create new book
      app.post('/api/books', function (req, res) {
        // create new book with form data (`req.body`)
        var newBook = new db.Book({
          title: req.body.title,
          image: req.body.image,
          releaseDate: req.body.releaseDate,
        });

        // this code will only add an author to a book if the author already exists
        db.Author.findOne({name: req.body.author}, function(err, author){
          newBook.author = author;
          // add newBook to database
          newBook.save(function(err, book){
            if (err) {
              console.log("create error: " + err);
            }
            console.log("created ", book.title);
            res.json(book);
          });
        });

      });
  ```

## 6. But the view from here is bad!
1. When you look at your view, instead of seeing the nicely listed author, you should see the author object.
![author object](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3010270/14153137/6c0b4432-f66b-11e5-9440-b122c471e746.png)

1. Why is this? Look at the data being returned from the server and fix the template string to show the author name!

  ```html
    <p>
      <b>${book.title}</b>
      <!-- just this next line is what needs to be changed! -->
      by ${book.author.name}
      <button type="button" name="button" class="deleteBtn btn btn-danger pull-right" data-id=${book._id}>Delete</button>
    </p>
  ```



## Revise Other CRUD methods to Account for Authors

On your own, use the mongoose methods to replace the other `/api/books*` routes with mongoose commands, taking into account the new referenced data relationship.

Make sure you look back to the lecture notes for info on the most important methods like:
* find
* deleteOne
* new
* save

- Sprint 3 - Embedded documents
Mongoose
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/mongoose-book-app/blob/master/docs/sprint3.md
# Sprint 3 - Embedded documents

## 1. Many unique characters belong to each book!

That's right: we're going to add Characters to each of the books.
Characters, however, are usually pretty unique to the book that they're in, so we'll be using an **embedded** document; embedding `Character` into the `Book` schema.  

1. Commit your work (so that you don't overwrite your old work).
2. Run `git checkout starting-point-sprint-3` to get the updated code that includes a frontend for characters. Inspect the solutions, especially the `POST api/books` route to see how to handle the case when an author is not yet saved in the database.
2. From here, `git checkout -b my-work-sprint-3.`
3. Startup the app making sure to `node seed.js` and `node server.js`.  
4. Take a look at the current UI in your web browser.  You should see that a new field has been added to each book listed.
5. Open your web browser developer tools.  Try to add a character to one of the books.  You should see an error message like: `jquery.min.js:4 POST http://localhost:3000/api/books/56fc1e8a8d4bcdb3e5e0092e/characters 404 (Not Found)`
  * What type of error is 404?


## 2. Creating the CharacterSchema

Since Characters will be embedded we can create it's schema either in its own file or in the same file as the document it will be embedded in.  Let's keep it simple this time; and create it in the the `models/book.js`.  

1. Add the CharacterSchema to `models/book.js` with one `name` attribute (keeping it simple for now).

  ```js
  // models/book.js
  var CharacterSchema = new Schema({
    name: String
  });
  ```

2. Now take a look at the `BookSchema`. Our current schema doesn't have any way of storing Character data.  Let's include characters using that Character Schema.

  Do you remember how to access an embedded Schema?  

  <details><summary>don't remember?  click here</summary>

    characters: [CharacterSchema]  // for multiple embedded items in an array
    mainCharacter: CharacterSchema // if you want one embedded item

  </details>




## 3. POST characters

At this point your Book model should be making use of Characters.  But since we haven't added anything to `server.js` yet, those characters can't be added by users and stored in the DB.

Since characters are part of Books we'll setup our URLs to reflect that.  

Example:

| METHOD  | ROUTE   | DESCRIPTION |
| ------- | --------------------------| ----------------|
| GET     | /api/books/:bookId/characters | get all the characters for this book |
| POST    | /api/books/:bookId/characters | add a new character to the book      |
| GET     | /api/books/:bookId/characters/:id | get a specific character from this book |
| PUT     | /api/books/:bookId/characters/:id | update a  character from this book |
| DELETE  | /api/books/:bookId/characters/:id | delete a character from this book |


We don't need all of these today; in fact we're only really going to worry about adding characters for now.


1. Add a new route to server.js:

  ```js
  app.post('/api/books/:book_id/characters', function (req, res)
  ```


2. See if you can get the book (`findById`) and then push the character into the book's `characters` array.  If the format fits, Mongoose will convert the object to a Character for you.  Finally you need to save the book and return the entire book as json.  (note that author is still a part of this so you'll need to populate it too.)

  Let's use this psuedo-code as an example:

  ```js
  // Create a character associated with a book
  app.post('/api/books/:book_id/characters', function (req, res) {
    // Get book id from url params (`req.params`)
    var bookId = req.params.book_id;
    db.Book.findById(bookId)
      .populate('author')
      .exec(function(err, foundBook) {
        // handle errors
        // push req.body into characters array

        // save the book with the new character
        // send the entire book back
        }
      }
    );
  });
  ```



  <details><summary>Spoiler</summary>  
  
  ```js
     // Create a character associated with a book
     app.post('/api/books/:book_id/characters', function (req, res) {
       // Get book id from url params (`req.params`)
       var bookId = req.params.book_id;
       db.Book.findById(bookId)
         .populate('author') // Reference to author
         // now we can worry about saving that character
         .exec(function(err, foundBook) {
           console.log(foundBook);
           if (err) {
             res.status(500).json({error: err.message});
           } else if (foundBook === null) {
             // Is this the same as checking if the foundBook is undefined?
             res.status(404).json({error: "No Book found by this ID"});
           } else {
             // push character into characters array
             foundBook.characters.push(req.body);
             // save the book with the new character
             foundBook.save();
             res.status(201).json(foundBook);
           }
         }
       );
     });
   ```
 
  </details>


## 4. Does it work yet?  Does it work yet?

1. Give it a shot now; the UI should just work.  If not make use of debugger or console.log messages to try and resolve any issues.  

2. We haven't pre-built any UI to make use of embed anywhere else, but if you have spare time you could try to work on the server-side for GET characters or DELETE characters.  Maybe you can even add a delete button to the UI next to each character.

# Python

Hey, Polyglots! Ready for another programming language?

## Prerequisites

- Know and use the basics of JavaScript

## Objectives

By the end of this, students should be able to:

-   Use the Python REPL
-   Compare and contrast basic language features and types from Python with basic language features and types from Javascript.
-   Write and run simple script in Python.

## Installation

1.  `brew install python3`
1.  Python doesn't ship with the most up to date version of package manager
pip, so upgrade pip : `pip3 install --upgrade pip`
1.  `pip3 install ipython`

## Python REPL

We'll be using Python's built-in REPL to practice what we learn today.

Typing `python3` onto the command line will bring you into this REPL using Python version 3.7.2, similar to calling `node` to run the `node` REPL. 

BUT! There's an even better way. With `ipython` we can enter python's REPL with syntax highlighting and way more features! So for this lesson we will be using `ipython`.

**note:** Your Mac has Python 2 installed already. Remember to use `python3`! There are several things in this course that will break if you try to run them in Python 2, which is what will run on most of your machines if you simply type `python`

To run Python scripts, simply run
`python3 filename.py` from the command line. If you _do_ want to run Python in version 2.7.0 or the original Python version install on your machine, simply call `python` without the extra 3.

_Hint: to print to the console in Python, we use `print("hello world")`_

Let's practice running some code in the Ipython.

&#x1F535; **Activity**
```
- In your terminal, open the Python REPL by typing `ipython`
- try some standard stuff, like adding numbers together, saving a string to a variable, and whatever else you want
- If you learn something, or something unexpected happens, share in a thread below
- 7 min
```  

## Core Syntax, Variables, and Operators

### Syntax

1. Snake Case: `keep_your_variables_defined_this_way` and `we_are_in_pythons_house_now`.
2. **Parens** `()` in Python are required around parameters at all times
3. Line breaks/ **whitespace** instead of semicolons, and closing curly braces!
4. **colons** `:` directly after the first line of the block statement, immediately followed by a new, indented line. Colons replace `{` in JS.

### Variables

Similar to JS, but different. 

```python
>>> x = 2 # assigns x to numerical value 2
>>> x = "Take it easy dude. But take it!" # reassigns x to string value
```

By default, variables are locally scoped. So `name = "Origen"` in Python is like `let name = "Origen"` in JS. 

For constants, there is no way to make a variable specifically unable to be changed! But it is a widely practiced _convention_ to declare constants in all caps: 

NUMBER_OF_DAYS_IN_A_WEEK = 7

### Booleans

In Python, true and false are represented by `True` and `False` (yes, case
matters).

The falsy values of Python are:

`False` `None` `0` `0.0` `''` `[]` `{}`

`None` is equivalent to Javscripts's `null`.

Now that you know some more stuff, lets excecute code from a file! 

&#x1F535; **Activity**
```
- create a new file "my_first_python.py"
- Add some code using what you've learned so far!
- Run your in terminal using `python3 /path/my_first_python.py`
- If you learn something, or something unexpected happens, share in a thread below
- 7 min
```  


### Operators

|                      |        JavaScript                    |        Python               |
|:---------------------|:------------------------------------:|:---------------------------:|
| logical operators    | `&&`, <code>&#124;&#124;</code>, `!` | `and`, `or`, `not`          |
| relational operators | `==` `!=` `>` `<` `>=` `<=`          | `==` `!=` `>` `<` `>=` `<=` |
| arithmetic operators | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`              | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`     |

#### Brief Aside: Double Slash (`//`) Operator

Integer division will always return a whole integer.  Division with Floats returns most accurate results.

In Python, this whole integer division behavior can be mirrored with the `//`
operator.

```python
>>> 14.5 / 3    # => 4.833333
>>> 14.5 // 3   # => 4.0
```

Note that operations on floats will still return floats no matter the operator.

To convert between floats and integers, use:

```python
>>> int(14.5)    # => 14
>>> float(14)    # => 14.0
```

## Strings

In Python, there is no difference between using `" "` or `' '`.
[Escape Characters](http://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/str/escapes.html)
are evaluated in both.

```python
>>> print("This is a \n new line.")
# => This is a
# => new line.
```

### String Interpolation

There are many options for string interpolation in Python. For our
purposes, we'll be using `.format()`, as it is preferred for Python 3.5.

`.format()` is appended to a string and takes a parameters the strings to be
concatenated. If the string contains empty `{}`s, the parameters fill the `{}`s
in the order passed in. If they contain a number (beginning with 0), they will
be mapped to the parameter passed to `.format()` at said index.

```python
>>> thing_to_do = "Take it"
>>> way_to_do_it = "easy"
>>> pronoun = "dude"

>>> "{} {} {}. But {}!".format(thing_to_do, way_to_do_it, pronoun, thing_to_do)
# => 'Take it easy dude. But Take it!'

>>> "{0} {1} {2}. But {0}!".format(thing_to_do, way_to_do_it, pronoun)
# => 'Take it easy dude. But Take it!'
```

## Flow Control

### Conditionals

Again, colons and whitespace are critical to working Python code. Aside from
that and the use of `elif` vs. `else if`, these should feel very similar to Javascript conditional statements.

```python
if x < 0:
  print('Negative')
elif x == 0:
  print('Zero')
else:
  print('Positive')
```

### Loops

Also like Javascript, Python employs `while` and `for` loops.

Python also allows for an optional `else` statement with each of these. With
`while` loops, the `else` statement is executed once the `while` condition is
no longer true. With `for` loops, `else` is executed upon the loop's
completion.

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
   print(count, " is  less than 5")
   count = count + 1
else:
   print(count, " is not less than 5")
```

```python
count = 15
for i in range(1,count):
  print(i)
else:
  print("done")
```

Again, this `else` is optional and different in nature from a conditional else.
It functions more as a completion handler.

## Functions

Functions in Python are much like in JavaScript. For example, like in JavaScript, functions need a
an **explicit return**.

Basic function structure:

```python
def function_example(param_one, param_two):
  """Example function returning string interpolation of parameters."""
  concat = "What a splendid function! I've got my {0} and {1}.".format(param_one, param_two)
  return concat
```

#### Brief Aside: Docstrings

You may have noticed something like

`"""This function..."""`

within each of our example functions. These are called `docstrings` and are
conventionally used in Python to provide documentation throughout a codebase.
Code will run fine without them, but that would stray from Python's conventions
as well as throw you into linter message hell. Try them out!

&#x1F535; **Activity** FizzBuzz!
```
- create a new file "fizzbuzz"
- Add the code to solve FizzBuzz, explained below. 
- You may have solved this in JavaScript or on a whiteboard before! 
- If you learn something, or something unexpected happens, share in a thread below
- 7 min
```  

_**Fizzbuzz** is a classic, easy whiteboard problem in interviews. Remarkably, many hiring managers report that a majority of their applicants cannot solve it._

_You write a function that will count from 1-99 printing 1 of four things for each number._
_If the number is divisible by 3, print "fizz"._
_If the number is divisible by 5, print "buzz"._
_If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "fizzbuzz"._
_And otherwise, just print the number._

_For the first 20 numbers, your console should look like this:_

```py
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
7
8
fizz
buzz
11
fizz
13
14
fizzbuzz
16
17
fizz
19
buzz
```


## Collections

### Lists

Python lists are comparable to JavaScript arrays. They store comma separated values
of varying data types between square brackets `[]`.

`len()` is used to get the length of a list in Python.

```python
len(secret_files) # => 300
```

We can merge lists together using the `+` operator:

```python
secret_files = ["TOP SECRET", "ALSO TOP SECRET", "DON'T EVEN LOOK AT THIS"]
new_secret_files = ["PRETTY DARN SECRET", "WE SEEM NOT TO BE TRUSTED QUITE AS MUCH WITH TOP SECRET", "MAYBE IT'S THAT WE LEAVE SECRETS IN ALL CAPS IN PLAIN TEXT]

secret_files = secret_files + new_secret_files
```

#### List Methods

- `.append()`  instead of `.push()`

```python
secret_files.append("He's guilty.")
```

`.pop()` removes the last element from a Python list. 

We do not have built-in operators for removing or adding to the _beginning_ of a
list! 

`.remove(n)` allows us to remove an element at any index. Thus, `list.remove(0)`
would remove the first element from a list.

#### Looping Through Lists

`for` loops with lists don't stray far from the loops we saw earlier.

```python
secret_files = ["TOP SECRET", "ALSO TOP SECRET", "DON'T EVEN LOOK AT THIS"]

for file in secret_files:
  print(lang)
```

## Dictionaries

---
### Dictionaries - Purpose
<br>

- **Dictionaries** are to Python as **objects** are to JS.

- In computer science these types are also known as _associative arrays_ or _maps_.

- A **dictionary** provides a container for **`key: value`** pairs. We can refer to `key: value` pairs as **items**.

- _Dictionaries_ have a class (type) of `dict`.

---
### Dictionaries - Basic Syntax
<br>

- Like _objects_ in JS, a **dictionary** is created with a set of _curly braces_:

	```python
	student = {
		'name': 'Fred',
		'course': 'WDI',
		'current_week': 4
	} 
	```
- Unlike in JS, _strings_ used as keys must be quoted.

---
### Dictionaries - Features
<br>

<p><em>Dictionaries</em> have the following features:

- They are unordered (just like JS objects)

- They are mutable:
 	- The values assigned to a key can be changed
 	- New `key: value` pairs (items) can be added
 	- Existing items can be deleted
 
- Any immutable type can be used as a key, including _numbers_ and _tuples_ (which we'll cover in a bit).

---
### Dictionaries - Getting/Setting Values
<br>

- We use _square brackets_ to get and set an item's value:

	```python
	name = student['name']
	print(name)
	> Fred
	student['name'] = 'Tina'
	print(name)
	> Tina
	```

- Unlike with _objects_ in JS, Python _dictionaries_ **have no dot notation**. 

---
### Dictionaries - <span style="text-transform: lowercase">get</span> Method
<br>

- Unlike JS which returns `undefined` when accessing a property that does not exist, a _dictionary_ will raise a `KeyError`.

- One option to avoid this error is to use the `get` method:

	```python
	birthdate = student['birthdate']
	> KeyError: 'birthdate'
	print( student.get('birthdate', 'unknown') )
	> unknown
	print( student.get('birthdate') )
	> None
	```

---
### Dictionaries - <span style="text-transform: lowercase">in</span> Operator
<br>

- Another way to avoid the `KeyError` is to use the `in` operator to check if the _dictionary_ includes a key:

	```python
	import datetime
	
	if 'birthdate' in student:
		today = datetime.datetime.today()
		is_birthday = (student['birthdate'].month == today.month and
			student['birthdate'].day == today.day)
	```

---
### Dictionaries - Adding Items
<br>

- Simply assigning to a _key_ that does not exist will create a new item in the dictionary:

	```python
	student['age'] = 21
	```

---
### Dictionaries - Deleting Items
<br>

- The `del` operator deletes an item from a _dictionary_:

	```python
	del student['age']
	'age' in student
	> False
	```

---
### Dictionaries - Number of Items
<br>

- Use the built-in `len` function to retrieve the number of items in a _dictionary_:

	```python
	print( student )
	> {'name': 'Tina', 'course': 'WDI'}
	len(student)
	> 2
	len({})
	> 0
	```

---
### Dictionaries - Iterating Items
<br>

- `for` loops are used to iterate over a dictionary's `key: value` pairs. However, the following is considered to be a Python [anti-pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern):

	```python
	for key in student:
	    print( f"{key} = {student[key]}" )
	```
	
- The preferred way is to use the `items()` method to obtain a [dictionary view object](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dictionary-view-objects)...

---
### Dictionaries - Iterating Items

- The best practice way to iterate over the items in a _dictionary_ is to use a `for` loop to iterate over a _dictionary view object_ as follows:

	```python
	for key, val in student.items():
	    print( f"{key} = {val}" )
	```

- The `student.items()` call above returns a wrapped set of _tuples_:

	```python
	student.items():
	> dict_items([('name', 'Tina'), ('course', 'WDI')])
	```

- The `for` statement assigns the values in a _tuple_ to multiple variables like with `key, val` above.

---
## Dictionary - Practice Exercise<br><small>(5 minutes)</small>
<br>

- Define a Python _dictionary_ named **`where_are_my_things`** containing a few items; where  the `keys` are things you have, and the `value` is the location you keep those things.

- Write a `for` loop that iterates over the items in the dictionary and prints each one as _My [thing] is kept [location]_.

HW for Monday Python state game
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/state-capitals

# Let's Learn our State Capitals

We're going to create a game to help us memorize the names of the capitals of all 50 states.

To play the game:

 - Your program should prompt the user to identify the capital associated with a given state.
 - There should be running tallies on the number of correct and incorrect answers for each state
 - After getting through all 50 states one time, users should be asked whether or not they want to play again.

### Game Requirements

 - Make sure the states don't appear in alphabetical order in the prompts. This will make the game a bit more challenging for the user.

 - Provide a welcome message to introduce the player to the game.

 - Initialize new keys in the dictionaries that store the number of times a user gets a capital `correct` and the number of times the answer is `wrong`.

 - Through all 50 states, prompt the user to name the capital of the state.
  - If the answer is correct, display a message saying so, and increment the `correct` key.
  - If the answer is wrong, display a message saying so, and increment the `wrong` key.
  - After each prompt, display a message telling the reader how many times the state was answered correctly out of the total number of times answered.

- Once the user has gone through all 50 states, ask them if they'd like to play again.

## Getting Started

 You're given an array of dictionaries that contain each state name and capital.

 > **Hint**: For the purposes of developing this program, start with a test array of three dictionaries so you don't have to play through all 50 states each time.

### Potentially Useful Methods

- `print`
- `input`
- `for loop`
- `sorted`
- `random.shuffle()`

## Bonus!

- Calculate a overall total score, display a running tally for each prompt
- If the user plays again, set the order of how the prompts appear to start with the ones they got wrong the most often.
- Add a hint functionality that prints the first 3 letters of a capital


## python
# Python Containers and Ranges

### Learning Objectives

<p>Students will be able to:</p>

- Use _lists_, _tuples_  as containers for data

- Use _list comprehensions_ to create lists

- Use a _range_ and a _for_ statement to loop through a range of integers

- Create subsets of a _sequence_ using the _slice_ operator

### Dictionary Review

- What are _dictionaries_ similar to in JS?
- Why won't the following code work?
 
```python
menu = {
	hamburger: 4.99,
	french_fries: 1.99,
	taco: 2.99
}
```
<br>

### General Purpose Containers

- As you know by now, applications frequently need to maintain collections of data within a _container_ data type.

- **What did we use in JS to hold collections of data?** array, object, json

- In this lesson, we're going to review the following Python built-in types commonly used as _containers_:
	- **lists** 
	- **tuples**
<br>

## Lists (are python Array in Javascript)
#### Lists - Purpose

- **Lists** are to Python as **arrays** are to JS.

- A **list** provides a container for zero or more items (_elements_).

- **Lists** can contain items of different types, including _dictionaries_ and nested _lists_.

- **List** have a class (type) of `list`.
<br>

#### Lists - Basic Syntax

- Like _arrays_ in JS, a **list** is created with a set of _square brackets_:

	```python
	colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'] 
	```

- The number of items in a _list_ is returned using the built-in `len()` function:

	```python
	len(colors)
	> 3
	```
<br>

#### Lists - Features

<p><em>Lists</em> have the following features:

- They are considered to be a _sequence_ type in Python. A _sequence_ is a generic term used for an **ordered** collection. Other _sequence_ types in Python include _strings_ and _tuples_.

- They are mutable:

 	- Items within the _list_ can be replaced
 	- Items can be added and removed from a _list_
<br>

#### Lists - Accessing Elements

- Accessing the individual elements of a _list_ is much like that as accessing elements in a JS array, i.e., by using an expression that evaluates to an _integer_ within _square brackets_:

	```python
	idx = 1
	colors[idx + 1]
	> blue
	```

- However, unlike in JS, we can use negative integers to index from the end of a _list_:

	```python
	colors[-1]
	> blue
	```
	No need to write code like `colors[len(colors) - 1]` - yay!
<br>

#### Lists - Assigning Elements

- We also use square brackets to target an element of a _list_ for assignment:

	```python
	colors[-1] = 'brown'
	print(colors)
	> ['red', 'green', 'brown']
	```
<br>

#### Lists - Adding Elements

- The equivalent to JS's `push()` method is `append()`:

	```python
	colors.append('purple')
	```
  colors
Out[9]: ['red', 'green', 'brown']

In [10]: colors.append('purple')  // append doesn't give you anything back

In [11]: colors
Out[11]: ['red', 'green', 'brown', 'purple']
	
	However, unlike JS's `push()` method, `append()` can only add one item and does not return a value.
	
- For adding multiple items, use the `extend()`:

	```python
	colors.extend(['orange', 'black'])
	```
<br>

In [11]: colors
Out[11]: ['red', 'green', 'brown', 'purple']

In [12]: colors.extend(['orange', 'black'])

In [13]: colors
Out[13]: ['red', 'green', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']

#### Lists - Inserting Elements

- To add items to anywhere but the end of a _list_, use the `insert()` method:

	```python
	print(colors)
	> ['red', 'green', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
	colors.insert(1, 'yellow')
	> ['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
	```

	colors.insert(1, 'yellow')
	> ['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
colors.insert(20, 'hithere!')
inserts to the end eventhough index is not present
<br>

#### Lists - Deleting Elements

- Yup, there's a `pop()` method, but it's more flexible in Python because you can specify the index of the element to remove and return:

	```python
	print(colors)
	> ['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
	green = colors.pop(2)
	print(colors)
	> ['red', 'yellow', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
	```
<br>

#### Lists - Deleting Elements

- If you don't care about the value returned by `pop()`, you can also use the `del` operator to delete items:

	```python
	print(colors)
	> ['red', 'yellow', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
	del colors[1]
	print(colors)
	> ['red', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
	```
<br>

#### Lists - Deleting Elements

- Also there's a `remove()` method that removes the first item that matches what you pass in:

	```python
	print(colors)
	> ['red', 'brown', 'purple', 'orange', 'black']
	colors.remove('orange')
	print(colors)
	> ['red', 'brown', 'purple', 'black']
	```
	No value is returned by the `remove()` method.
<br>

#### Lists - Clearing

- Lastly, `clear()` does just what you think:

	```python
	print(colors)
	> ['red', 'brown', 'purple', 'black']
	colors.clear()
	print(colors)
	> []
	```
<br>

#### Lists - Iteration

- The `for` loop is used to iterate over the items in a _list_:

	```python
	colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
	for color in colors:
		print(color)
	> red
	> green
	> blue
	```
<br>

In [28]: colors.extend(['red', 'yellow', 'brown', 'purple', 'or
    ...: ange', 'black'])

In [29]: for color in colors:
    ...:     print('{} is my favoritecolor'.format(color))
    ...:
red is my favoritecolor
yellow is my favoritecolor
brown is my favoritecolor
purple is my favoritecolor
orange is my favoritecolor
black is my favoritecolor

#### Lists - Iteration

- If we need to access the index of the item while iterating a _list_, we use the built-in `enumerate()` function to provide the index and the value to a `for` loop:

	```python
	for idx, color in enumerate(colors):
		print(idx, color)
	> 0 red
	> 1 green
	> 2 blue
	```
<br>

## List Review

- **What are _lists_ similar to in JS?**
array
- **What is a way to add items to a _list_?**
colors[0] = 'yellow'

- **What is a way to remove an item from the front of a _list_?**
pop(i)
---
## List Comprehensions
<br>

#### List Comprehensions

- One of the most powerful features in Python are _list comprehensions_.

- _List comprehensions_ provide a concise way to create and work with lists.

- They will probably seem a little confusing as first, but they certainly are a favorite of _Pythonistas_ and you will certainly come across them when googling.

- Also, _comprehensions_ can be used similarly to create _dictionaries_ too.
<br>

#### List Comprehensions <small>Numerical Example</small>

- If we needed to square all of the numbers in a _list_ and put them into a new _list_, we might use a for loop like this:

	```python
	nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
	
	# I want 'n * n' for each 'n' in nums 
	squares = []
	for n in nums:
		squares.append(n * n) // number times itself 1*1, 2*2
	print(squares)
	> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
	```

- **What method in JS would we use in this scenario?**
we would use .map()
<br>

- A _list comprehension_ can reduce this code:
  - python they ask for list comprehension job interview*****
	```python
	# I want 'n * n' for each 'n' in nums 
	squares = []
	for n in nums:
		squares.append(n * n)
	```
	To this:
	
	```python
	# I want 'n * n' for each 'n' in nums 
	squares = [n * n for n in nums]
	```
in javascript:
nums.map(ele => {
  return ele * ele
})

- The _comprehension_ is basically an advanced `for` loop within _square brackets_ which, of course, returns a new _list_.
<br>

#### List Comprehensions - Basic Syntax

- Here's the basic syntax of a _list comprehension_:

	```python
	# [<expression> for <item> in <list>]
	# This reads as: I want <expression> for each <item> in <list>
	```
<br>

#### List Comprehensions - Filtering

- We've seen how _list comprehensions_ are a nice way to map a list, but they can be used for **filtering** too.

- Just like before, let's first look at how we would use a `for` loop to map and filter simultaneously:

	```python
	nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
	
	# I want 'n * n' for each 'n' in nums  if 'n * n' is even, store only the number that are even numbers
	even_squares = []
	for n in nums:
		square = n * n 
		if square % 2 == 0:
			even_squares.append(square)
	print(even_squares)
	> [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
	```
<br>

#### List Comprehensions - Filtering

- Again _list comprehensions_ reduce the mapping and filtering from:

	```python
	# I want 'n * n' for each 'n' in nums  if 'n * n' is even
	even_squares = []
	for n in nums:
		square = n * n 
		if square % 2 == 0:
			even_squares.append(square)
	```
	To this one-liner:
	
	```python
	# I want 'n * n' for each 'n' in nums  if 'n * n' is even
  # I will only store if (n * n) % 2 == 0 
	even_squares = [n * n for n in nums if (n * n) % 2 == 0]
	```
	Nice and readable!

  In [34]: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

In [35]: even_squares = [n * n for n in nums if (n * n) % 2 ==
    ...: 0]

In [36]: even_squares
Out[36]: [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
<br>

#### List Comprehensions - Review

- **What characters start and end a _list comprehension_**
square bracket
- **Do _list comprehensions_ create or loop through lists?**
yes, it loops thru, and creates a list (array)
<br>

#### List Comprehensions - Summary

- We've only scratched the surface of _list comprehensions_.

- They can even be used to create lists of _tuples_ that would otherwise require nested `for` loops.

- Speaking of **tuples**...
<br>

## Tuples
<br>

#### Tuples - Purpose

- **Tuples** in Python are very similar to **lists**.

- _Tuples_ have a class (type) of `tuple`.
<br>

#### Tuples - Basic Syntax

- _Tuples_ can be defined in a few different ways.  Most basically, they are defined like this:

	```python
	colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
	print(colors)
	> ('red', 'green', 'blue')
	print( len(colors) )
	> 3
	``` 
	Although it seems that _parentheses_ are used to create _tuples_, it's actually the _commas_.
<br>

#### Tuples - Basic Syntax

- _Tuples_ can be created without using any parentheses:

	```python
	colors = 'red', 'green', 'blue'
	print(type(colors))
	> <class 'tuple'>
	```

  In [39]: pokemon = ("char", "pika", "rattata")

In [40]: print(pokemon)
('char', 'pika', 'rattata')

In [41]: len(pokemon)
Out[41]: 3

In [42]: pokemon2 = 'char', 'pika', 'ratata'

In [43]: print(type(pokemon2))
<class 'tuple'>

- However, creating single-item _tuples_ without parens requires a trailing comma:

	```python
	colors = 'purple',  # tuple, not a string because of the trailing comma!!
	print(type(colors), len(colors))
	> <class 'tuple'> 1
	print(colors)
	> ('purple',)
	```
> pokemon2[0] = 'fun'
---------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                     Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-44-c90600ebbf78> in <module>
----> 1 pokemon2[0] = 'fun'

TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
<br>


### Differences Between Tuples & Lists

- _Tuples_ are immutable, so they are great for protecting data that you don't want changed. therfore, quicker iteration!!

- Because they are immutable, iterating over _tuples_ is faster than with _lists_. They can also be used as _keys_ for _dictionaries_.

- Generally, you'll find that _tuples_ are used to contain heterogeneous (different) data types and _lists_ for homogeneous (similar) data types.

- _Tuples_ are often classified based on how many elements they contain, e.g., a **2-tuple** would be used to hold a `key` and its `value`.
<br>

#### Tuples - Accessing Elements

- Although _tuples_ can't be modified like _lists_, we can retrieve their elements in exactly the same way:

	```python
	colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
	green = colors[1]
	print(green)
	> green
	```
- _Sequences_ also have an `index()` method that returns the index of the first match:

	```python
	colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
	blue_idx = colors.index('blue')
	print(blue_idx)
	> 2
	```
  print(pokemon.index(0))
<br>	

### Tuples - Iteration

- Just like with _lists_, other _sequences_ are iterated upon in the same way - by using `for` loops:

	```python
	colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
	for idx, color in enumerate(colors):
		print(idx, color)
	> 0 red
	> 1 green
	> 2 blue
	```

In [45]: for idx in enumerate(pokemon):
  ...:     print(idx)
  ...:
(0, 'char')
(1, 'pika')
(2, 'rattata')

In [47]: for idx, pokeone in enumerate(pokemon):
    ...:     print(idx, pokeone)
    ...:
    ...:
0 char
1 pika
2 rattata
<br>

#### Tuples - Unpacking (are python in destructuring are JavaScript)

- _Tuples_ have a convenient feature, called _unpacking_, for doing multiple variable assignment:

	```python
	colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')

	A tuple of variables on the left-side of the assignment operator and a tuple of values on the right is all it takes.
<br>

## Ranges
<br>

#### Ranges - Purpose

- Although not a general purpose container, **ranges** are a _sequence type_ like _lists_ and _tuples_.

- The **range** type represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for looping a specific number of times in `for` loops.

- _Ranges_ have a class (type) of `range`.
<br>

#### Ranges - Basic Syntax

- **Ranges** can only be created by invoking the `range()` class:

	```python
	for num in range(5):
		print(num)
	> 0
	> 1
	> 2
	> 3
	> 4
	```
	Notice that by default, the sequence starts at `0` and goes up to, but does not including the integer passed in.
<br>

#### Ranges - Basic Syntax

- _Ranges_ can also generate sequences with a **start** and a **step**:

	```python
	for even in range(2, 10, 2):  #start at 2, stop upto 10 not included, step up 2 at a time
		print(even)
	> 2
	> 4
	> 6
	> 8
	```

for num in range(0, 10, 1) #start at 0 stop upto 10 not included, 1 step at a time

- When not passed in, the _start_ value defaults to `0` and the _step_ defaults to `1`.
<br>

#### Ranges - Basic Syntax

- _Ranges_ can also be used to create _lists_ and _tuples_:

	```python
	nums = list(range(10))
	print(nums)
	> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
	odds = tuple(range(1, 10, 2))
	print(odds)
	> (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
	```
<br>

#### Ranges - Negative Step

- If the _step_ is a negative integer, the _sequence_ counts down:

	```python
	for num in range(5, 0, -1): # we can step down decrement down, end at 0 but not including, start at 5
		print(num)
	> 5
	> 4
	> 3
	> 2
	> 1
	```
<br>

## Sequences Can Be "Sliced" (are python to slicing are javascript)
  slicing (startingplace , stopplace) and cuts out what in the middle
#### Slicing Sequences

- Python is known for having some cool tricks up its sleeve, for one, there's the "slice" operator (`[m:n]`).

- Since _sequence_ types are a collection of items (BTW, characters are the items in a _string_), we should be to target any subset of those items. We can, and those subsets are called _slices_.
<br>

#### Slicing Sequences

- Just like with indexing, slicing uses _square brackets_, but adds a _colon_:

	```python
	short_name = 'Alexandria'[0:4]  # starting place and number of times we want to slice (4 times)
	print(short_name)
	> Alex
	```

- Note that the slice includes up to, but not including the index to the right of the colon.
<br>

#### Slicing Sequences

- If the first index is omitted, the slice copies the _sequence_ starting at the beginning:

	```python
	colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
	print( colors[:2] )
	> ('red', 'green')
	```
  In [64]: pokemon
Out[64]: ('char', 'pika', 'rattata')

In [65]: pokemon[:1]
Out[65]: ('char',)

In [66]: pokemon 
Out[66]: ('char', 'pika', 'rattata') # no modification since tuple is immutatble

In [67]: pokemon[1:]
Out[67]: ('pika', 'rattata')

In [68]: pokemon
Out[68]: ('char', 'pika', 'rattata')
 
- If the up to index is omitted, the slice copies the _sequence_ all the way to the end:

	```python
	colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
	print( colors[1:] )
	> ['green', 'blue']
	```
<br>

#### Slicing Sequences - Question

- **What would the value of `fruit_copy` be?**

	```python
	fruit = ('apples', 'bananas', 'oranges')
	fruit_copy = fruit[:]
	```
  In [68]: pokemon
Out[68]: ('char', 'pika', 'rattata')

In [69]: pokemon_copy = pokemon[:]

In [70]: pokemon_copy
Out[70]: ('char', 'pika', 'rattata')
<br>

## Conclusion

- Python offers amazing power, convenience and readability with features such as _list comprehensions_ and _slicing_.

- However, as usual, it takes practice to become "comfortable" with these concepts, so on to the lab...

## Exercises
https://git.generalassemb.ly/WebDev-Connected-Classroom/lists_and_ranges_pylab/edit/master/README.md
#### Exercise 1

- Create a list named `students` containing some student names (strings).
- Print out the second student's name.
- Print out the last student's name.

#### Exercise 2

- Create a tuple named `foods` containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the `students` list.
- Use a `for` loop to print out the string "_food goes here_ is a good food"

#### Exercise 3

- Using a `for` loop, print just the last two food strings from `foods`.

#### Exercise 4

- Create a dictionary named `home_town` containing the keys of `city`, `state` and `population`.
- Print a string with this format:<br>"I was born in _city_, _state_ - population of _population_"

#### Exercise 5

- Iterate over the _key: value_ pairs in `home_town` and print a string for each item, for example:<br>"city = Arcadia"<br>"state = California"<br>"population = 58000"

#### Exercise 6

- Create an empty list named `cohort`.
- Using a `for` loop, add one dictionary to the `cohort` list for each student name. Each dictionary should have this shape:

	```python
	{
		'student': 'Tina',
		'fav_food' 'Cheeseburger'
	}
	```
- Iterate over `cohort` printing out each element.

#### Exercise 7

- Using the list of `students` and list comprehension, assign to a variable named `awesome_students` a new list containing strings similar to this:<br>["Tina is awesome!", "Fred is awesome!", "Wilma is awesome!"]
- Iterate over `awesome_students` printing out each string.

#### Exercise 8

- Using the tuple `foods` and list comprehension within a `for` loop, print each food string that contains the letter `a`.

# Intro to Objects and Classes https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/python-classes/edit/master/README.md

## Learning Objectives
* Describe the difference between classes and objects
* Use Python syntax to define a class
* Instantiate an object from a class
* Explain the use of the `__init__` method
* Utilize the `self` keyword in the scope of class variables and methods
* Understand class variables and how they differ from instance variables

# Objects and Classes

Python is an **object oriented programming language**. Object oriented programming is characterized
by the creation and use of collections of data and behavior that act like everyday physical objects.
Every day we interact with objects like chairs, beverages, cars, other people, etc. These objects have
properties that define them and behaviors we can execute to interact with them. What are some examples
of properties? Well, a chair could perhaps be wood or plastic. Cars have different shapes, colors, and
speeds. Beverages could be hot or cold. And behaviors or actions of the objects would include things
like sitting in chairs, driving cars, or drinking and refilling beverages. Over many years,
programmers have found that designing systems to reflect discrete, everyday objects makes the systems
easier to understand, write, test, and maintain.

You will hear people say that "everything is an object" in Python. What this means is that nearly
every variable you declare already has a set of properties and functions that it can use because it
is an object. Every string, number, list, dictionary, etc. has a set of behaviors and properties that
are "baked-in" because they are instances of a class. For example, every list you declare is an
instance of a built-in Python List class and because of that you can use any of the built-in list
functions like append() and pop() on your own list.

So what is a class? A class is the blueprint for an object. Let's think about the car: all cars have
things that make them a car:

* Has an engine
* Has tires
* Has doors
* Ability to drive
* Ability to park

But when we make a car, we vary the values of these properties. Some cars have economy engines, some
have performance engines. Some have 4 doors, others have 2. The blueprint or specification for the car
is the **class** and each car that we make from that blueprint is the **object**.

Making our own classes to organize data in the ways we want is a very common thing in programming.
Python gives us, for example, a string and an integer, but if we want to store a bunch of data where
each item contains a string **and** an integer **and** a function that prints them out nicely, we
can make a class for that and then each object we make from that class will have all that baked-in.

## Codealong: Write a basic class in PYTHON!!!

I like dogs. Here's what a Dog class definition might look like in Python:
In python they got rid of curly bracket. {} but you must indent!!
```python
class Dog(): # remember () after function
  def __init__(self, name="", age=0):  # __ double underscore init method in python initializer (constructor in JS), self - this belongs to the class, required argument you pass into constructor always!!, self parameter is most important!!!, name, age are instance variables
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def bark_hello(self): # self is parameter must be passed (this in JS)
    print("Woof! I am called", self.name, "and I am", self.age, "human-years old.")

```

The `Dog` class is a collection of **variables** and **methods**. The `__init__` method is a special
method Python executes when a new dog is created. It is short for "initialize" and is used to set
the values of the properties of the object. We will talk about this shortly. The variables in
this class are `self.name` and `self.age`. The method in this class is `bark_hello`.

## Instantiating Objects From Classes

By defining the dog class we now know the structure that each of our dogs will have: each has a name,
an age, and each can bark Hello! But how do we make new dogs? We call our class name as a function:

```python
gracie = Dog("Gracie", 8)
```

This will create a new object according to our Dog class specification. When that happens, Python runs
our `__init__` method to initialize the object. Here, we are telling our `__init__` method to set the
name of this dog to 'Gracie' and set her age to 8 years old.

> So, what's this `self` keyword inside the `__init__` method? `self` can be a strange programming paradigm. Imagine that you are an object. You represent the `self.` If you wanted to access your arm, it would be self.arm. Your name would probably be stored in self.name. This lets each object made from a class keep reference to its own data and function members. Not every "Person" has the same name so we want individual People to maintain their own names. The `self` keyword is each object's identity.

When we make objects from this class, the `self` keyword inside each object refers to that specific object. This allows each object made from a class to maintain its own copies of variables. Any method in our class that will need to use the `self` keyword (like our `bark_hello` method which uses both `self.name` and `self.age`) needs to have the `self` keyword passed in as a parameter to the method. That's why we include `self` in our `__init__` and `bark_hello` methods.

Let's make a couple more dogs so we can see the differences in our dog objects:

```python
spitz = Dog("Spitz", 5)  # lead dog
buck = Dog("Buck", 3)  # upstart newcomer
```

Each dog has its own name and age. Let's have them say hello:

```python
gracie.bark_hello()  # Woof! I am called Gracie and I am 8 human-years old.'
spitz.bark_hello()   # Woof! I am called Spitz and I am 5 human-years old.'
buck.bark_hello()    # Woof! I am called Buck and I am 3 human-years old.'
```

Notice how, even though `self` is listed as a parameter for the `bark_hello` function, we don't
pass it into the function. It happens automatically. Clearly, there is some magic at work here.
Let's add some more code to better see what is going on behind the scenes.

## Code-Along: Write a class that prints a string when instantiated

We are going to extend our Dog class, a bit. Let's give our dogs a color attribute. We need to
add a `self` variable for the color and we need to add a color parameter in the `__init__`
method. Now add a line to print out name and the object address when `__init__` fires. Lastly,
add your dog's color to their hello function. Now your Dog class looks like this:

```python
class Dog():
  def __init__(self, name="", age=0, color=""):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
    self.color = color
    print(name, "created:", self)

  def bark_hello(self):
    print("Woof! I am called", self.name, "I am", self.color "and I am", self.age, "human-years old.")
```

class Dog():
  #  self refers to class, local variable: a, n='' is defaulting my argmts string and number,
  # self is only exist inside of class you never specify it when creating outside of the class
  def __init__(self, n='', a='0'):
    self.name = n
    self.age = a #a is local variable and self.age is instance variable, scope is defined within the class. self.a
    
  def bark_hello(self):
    # f equal to backticks in JS. {self.name} we are refering to name inside of 
    print(f'Woof! I am called {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old')

# instantiate class JS is NEW keyword Python we do it directly
# calling Dog class initialize n value gracie, I am not sending age since it has a default val 0; a='0'
gracie = Dog('gracie')
gracie.bark_hello()

lassie = Dog('lassie', 1) # give a age, name
lassie.bark_hello()
<!-- output -->
Woof! I am called gracie and I am 0 years old
Woof! I am called lassie and I am 1 years old
<!-- -->
- memory location is different, object that is instantiated each has its own space!
3 instances of bark methods



With our class refactored, we will see new behavior. Add some colors to your dog instantiation
lines and then run the code to see what is output when we create new dog objects.

```python
gracie = Dog("Gracie", 8, "black") # Gracie created: <__builtin__.Dog instance at 0x7fecda802a70>
spitz = Dog("Spitz", 5, "white")  # Spitz created: <__builtin__.Dog instance at 0x7fecda802b48>
buck = Dog("Buck", 3, "brown")  # Buck created: <__builtin__.Dog instance at 0x7f6a23e93b90>

gracie.bark_hello()  # Woof! I am called Gracie I am black and I am 8 human-years old.'
spitz.bark_hello()   # Woof! I am called Spitz I am white and I am 5 human-years old.'
buck.bark_hello()    # Woof! I am called Buck I am brown and I am 3 human-years old.'
```

So we can see that each dog is created at a new address in memory. Each dog maintains its own
name, age and color. And each dog prints its name and memory address when it is created. The
`__init__` method will always execute once and only once when you create a new object from a class.

## Class vs instance members

python use class variable, **instance variables** belongs to that objct that was created

In our `Dog` class, we have variables attached to the `self` property that exist
independently for each object that's created. These are called **instance variables**.
Each object instance has its own copies of these variables and they can vary across
objects. We can also attach variables to the class itself so that there's one single thing that
exists for an entire class. These are called **class variables**.

Suppose we want to keep a tally of how many dogs we have running around in our app.
We could put a copy of the tally in each dog object but that's not efficient: we would
be duplicating a value in memory multiple times and we would have to update the value in every dog
object in order to keep it accurate. It's much better if we can store it once in the class.
That way, each dog object can access it but we only need to store it and set it in one place.

Let's add some code to our class. To create a class variable, we simply add a variable outside
of any existing functions. Let's add a `totalDogs` variable to the class. Let's also add a
line that increments this value inside our `__init__` method. And just for fun, let's add
another line to our `bark_hello` method that references this total:

```python
class Dog():
  totalDogs = 0
  def __init__(self, name="", age=0 color=""):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
    self.color = color
    Dog.totalDogs += 1
    print(name, "created:", self)

  def bark_hello(self):
    print("Woof! I am called", self.name, "I am", self.color "and I am", self.age, "human-years old.")
    print("There are", Dog.totalDogs, "dogs in this room!")
```

Now when we create a new dog, the `__init__` method increments the `totalDogs` counter which
is stored in the Dog class itself. We can access the value stored in `Dog.totalDogs` inside our script
and each dog object can access it from their own functions.

## Subclasses and Inheritance

- in javascript: extends (we used it in react)
Python also provides a way for you to make a class "inherit" functionality from a different "parent" class. If you had a general class like `Dog` and you decided that you wanted to represent the more specific characteristics of certain breeds, you could create individual breed classes that each inherited all the members of `Dog` like `name`, `age`, `color`, and `bark_hello()`. Or perhaps having `Dog` be a subclass of an even-more-general `Animal` class. When we organize our classes like this we can save ourselves the time of writing code over again. All we need to do to get all the stuff in one class is to inherit it into a child class and then we can add or change anything we want and our changes are specific to this new child class.

We can see examples of inheritance in both JavaScript and Python. In JavaScript, the `HTMLElements` that we get when we call `document.getElementById()` seem like they have an `innerHTML` property but this is an inherited property from its parent class (or super class) `Element`, which itself is a subclass of `Node` which is actually where `textContent` comes from. Because `HTMLElement` is a descendent of these super classes, it can access all of these properties. It has inherited them.

In Python, we have strings and lists. Each one has a grandparent class called `sequence` which is the thing that `len()` works on. Strings and lists inherit this characteristic from `sequence` but each one has a different parent class. Sequence has two child classes: `mutable` and `immutable`. String inherits from `immutable` and List inherits from `mutable`.

Here is how we make it work:

- in JAVASCRIPT we called `super` when we are calling the parent class

```python
class Parent():
  def __init__(self):
    self.first_name = "Lorelei"
    self.last_name = "Gilmore"
    print("Parent initialized:", self)
  def hello(self):
    print(f"Hey, I'm {self.first_name}. Welcome to the Dragonfly!")

class Child(Parent): # child clss is inheritance of parent  instead of extend we have (parent)
  def __init__(self):
    Parent.__init__(self) # initialize parent class super keywork in js, here parent initialize first then initialize yourself
    self.first_name = "Rory" # why do have to do this? class chaining (parent > chid)? class is form of a tree.  
    #Obje is a class that needs to initizlie without actually initializing it first.
    print("Child initialized:", self)

mom = Parent()
daughter = Child() 

mom.hello()
daughter.hello()

print(daughter.last_name)
```

## let's create a grandchild
```python
class Parent():
  def __init__(self):
    self.first_name = "Lorelei"
    self.last_name = "Gilmore"
    print("Parent initialized:", self)
  def hello(self):
    print(f"Hey, I'm {self.first_name}. Welcome to the Dragonfly!")

class Child(Parent): # child clss is inheritance of parent  instead of extend we have (parent)
  def __init__(self):
    Parent.__init__(self) # initialize parent class super keywork in js, here parent initialize first then initialize yourself
    self.first_name = "Rory" # why do have to do this? class chaining (parent > chid)? class is form of a tree.  
    #Obje is a class that needs to initizlie without actually initializing it first.
    print("Child initialized:", self)

class GrandChild(Child):
  def __init__(self):
    Child.__init__(self)
    Parent.__init__(self)
    self.first_name = "Heggy"
    print("GrandChild initialized:", self)

mom = Parent()
daughter = Child() 

mom.hello()
daughter.hello()

print(daughter.last_name)
```

- chaining of class (inherited from the `Parent` class)
   Obj
    |
  string
    |
  Parent
    |
  Child
    |
  GrandChild

After examining this code, we see that the `Child` class doesn't actually contain a `hello()` method or a `last_name` property. But we can access those members because they are inherited from the `Parent` class. This shows how we can automatically add the parent's members to our class but it also illustrates a problem: The `mom` and `daughter` objects are maintaining their own `first_name`s but they say the same line when we call `hello()`.

We can change the behavior by `overriding` the function we inherited from the parent. Update `Child` to the following:

```python
class Child(Parent):
  def __init__(self):
    Parent.__init__(self)
    self.first_name = "Rory"
    print("Child initialized:", self)
  def hello(self):
    print(f"I'm {self.first_name}. Can't talk, late for class!")
```

Now the daughter says something more in line with her character. The child class still inherited the `hello()` method but the functionality we put into `Child` overrode what was inherited.

## (If time permits) Exercise: Create Your Own Python Classes

Now that we've seen a dog-based example of Python classes, let's make one a bit more sophisticated.
Create a `BankAccount` class.  

* Bank accounts should be created with the `accountType` property (like "savings" or "checking").
* Bank accounts should have a class-level variable tracking the total amount of money in all account objects.
* Each account should keep track of its own current `balance`.
* Each account should have a `deposit` and a `withdraw` method.
* Each account should start with its `balance` set to zero.

Things to think about:
* Any starting values for variables should be set in the `__init__` method
* Class variables are declared inside the class but outside any methods
* Instance variables are declared inside the `__init__` method
* Does your `__init__` method need to accept any parameters?

Bonus: 

1. Start each account with an additional `overdraftFees` property that starts at zero. If a call
to `withdraw` ends with the `balance` below zero then `overdraftFees` should be incremented by twenty.
2. Make a `ChildBankAccount` class that inherits from `BankAccount`. The `ChildBankAccount` should override the `withdraw` method so that no overdraft fees are applied. Instead, output a message that there are insufficient funds available.


## Closing Thoughts
* A Class is a pre-defined structure that contains attributes and behaviors that are grouped together logically. (All dogs have traits and actions they can do.)
* An Object is an instance of a Class structure.  A class could be thought of as a house blueprint and an object as a house built from the blueprint.
* Classes are defined via a method call. Classes contain an `__init__` method that takes in parameters to be assigned to an Object.
* Instance variables contain data types declared in the class but defined in each object. (Each dog has its own name.)
* Class variables and methods contain data and actions that span across all Objects. (How many dogs are there in total.)
* The `self` keyword lets us distinguish between variables that exist at the class level versus in each object.
* A Class can inherit properties and methods from another Class.

## Structured Query Language (SQL)

#### Installing Postgres


1.  Run the command `brew install postgres`
2.  Let's install using-

	3.  [Post gres app](https://postgresapp.com/)
	3.  Move the app to your `/Applications/` directory.
	4.  Now, double-click it to run it.
	5.  Select **Open Postgres** in the bottom-right corner.
			
			OR
			
	1. Run `brew tap homebrew/services` to install brew services.
	2. Then run `brew services start postgresql` to start postgres as a background service
	3. To stop postgres manually, run `brew services stop postgresql`. You can also use brew services to restart Postgres `brew services restart postgresql`


####  LIST ALL THE DATABASES!

### how to start db start sql database db start psql:
1) run `Postgres` app from your app list (close all 5 finger gesture)
    - open postgres db
    - you will see terminal open up, 
  > psql postgres // inside of terminal
  > \l // list all db 
  > ctrl + D // to get out of psql postgres instance.
**** create db ******
  > CREATE DATABASE world;
  > psql postgres // inside of terminal
  > \l // list all db 
  > ctrl + D // to get out of psql postgres instance.
**** connect to your db ******
  back inside of Postgres terminal
  > \c world // connect to db called world

Seeding my postgres: 
1) > cd GA/wdi/sf-wdi-51-assignments/heggy-heggy231/week8/psql-carmen-san-diego-lab-master
2) create new database using postgres app I d/l today
3) click on postgres database icon
4) in sided of terminal
  > psql postgres // inside of psql shell
  > \l // see all db 
  > ctrl + d // exit out psql postgres instance

5) Create db:
  > CREATE DATABASE world;
  > psql postgres // inside of terminal
  > \l // list all db 
  > ctrl + D // to get out of psql postgres instance.
  // => You are now connected to database "world" as user "Heggy".
  // cd into my project root dir
  > psql -U Heggy -d world -a -f ./starter-code/world.sql
6) ***************************** connect to your db ******************************
  back inside of Postgres terminal
  > \c world // connect to db called world

2) run postico ()

* We've provided a cheatsheet of Postgres commands to help you out.
* First thing's first - let's run `psql postgres` on the terminal 
* Now, let'ssee if we have any databases!
* `\l` to list **all** databses using the following command:

in psql
* \dt // Show me the database

### SQL vs noSQL:
* SQL: tabular (everthing is form of table), bad performace vs NoSQL, Relational (connect to othe SQL table, within db they are connected to other table are connected some way), 
        Primary Key(key is always unique), Data is referenced, ACID (automacity of data, all table gets updated: only when all is updated you get the data where noSQL gives you data eventhough things are not all updated), 
        structured (pre-defined, what types of data ahead of time predefined what you will store in your db)

  * ga
      |- course   (course can have many students)
      |- students (students can only take one course)

- drawing of our table ga
<img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/cb093bfd-142f-45b3-bdb4-52ff49e0a1c2%2FScreen%20Shot%202019-03-13%20at%2011.39.53%20AM.png?1552502474177">


#### Creating a database

* This is pretty straigtforward!
* Let's tell Postgres to create a database with a name!
* Syntax **matters**. Close each statement with a `;`
* `CREATE DATABASE ga;`
* Run the list command to see our new database!
* To remove a database use `DROP DATABASE databasename;`

#### Connecting to your database

* Time to connect to our database.
* We can do that with the following syntax:
* `\c databasename`
* In our case, `\c ga`
* We can't do anything inside of our DB until we connect to it.

####  Creating tables in a Database

* We specify to `CREATE TABLE name_of_table();`
* We pass in attribute names inside of the parenthases.

```sql
CREATE TABLE courses 
(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name varchar(255), code varchar(200));
```
SELECT * FROM <table-name> LIMIT 10;
// shows top 10 
> SELECT * FROM routes LIMIT 10;

```sql
CREATE TABLE courses //courses nameing the db 
(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name varchar(255), code varchar(200));
// SERIAL is increment the id, remember all db sql needs to
// name varchar(255) 255 is the length

ga=# CREATE TABLE courses
ga-# (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name varchar(255), code varchar(200)); // here we are passing courses to have 3 argument but primary key you do'nt give 
// => CREATE TABLE

\dt // Show me the database
ctrl + c // when terminal acting up!!
```


* Let's break this down...
* SERIAL PRIMARY KEY sets our Primary Key.
* We can now define the rest of our values using `attribute_name` with an associated `value_type`
* We organize them using commas to split them up.
* You can also use `\d+ tablename` to describe the table.

#### Listing tables in a database

* To see a list of all tables in a database...
* Run the following command:
* `\dt`


#### Adding rows to a database

Check this syntax out:

```sql
INSERT INTO courses (name, code)
VALUES
('Web Developement Immersive', 'WDI');
```

```sql
INSERT INTO courses (name, code) // look we are just giving 2 when we started with 3 earlier ((id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name varchar(255), code varchar(200)))
VALUES
('Web Developement Immersive', 'WDI');
```

```sql
ga=# INSERT INTO courses (name, code)
ga-# VALUES
ga-# ('Web Developement Immersive', 'WDI');
// => INSERT 0 1
```
* We don't need to include a Primary Key.
* Why? Remember auto-incremement?
* When we add a new row we get an automatic ID!
* We just specify the attributes to add into.
* And then we specify the **Values**!


#### Selecting rows from a database

* We can select all the rows!
* We use the **SELECT** statement!

```sql
SELECT * FROM courses;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM courses; // show * <= all columns
```

* We can look for specific rows!

```sql
SELECT * FROM courses WHERE id = 1;
```

Nice, eh?

Now, let's create another table 'students' where each student can take one course at a time.

```sql
CREATE TABLE students 
(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), email VARCHAR(200), 
course_id INTEGER REFERENCES courses(id));

INSERT INTO students (name, email, course_id)
VALUES
('Jimbo', 'jimbo@ga.co', 1);

SELECT * FROM students;
```

ga=# SELECT * FROM courses;
                   ga
 id |            name            | code 
----+----------------------------+------
  1 | Web Developement Immersive | WDI
  2 | Data Science Immersive     | DSI
(2 rows)

```sql
CREATE TABLE students 
// id can be anything, serial: auto generate, name datatype of  VARCHAR(255)
(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), email VARCHAR(200), 

// course_id is column name you created earlier, INTEGER REFERENCES courses(id) <= tableName(columnName) <= give relation SQL 
course_id INTEGER REFERENCES courses(id));

---> check if you have new student table
> \dt // check if sql db has my new students table
         List of relations
 Schema |   Name   | Type  | Owner 
--------+----------+-------+-------
 public | courses  | table | Heggy
 public | students | table | Heggy

INSERT INTO students (name, email, course_id)
VALUES
('Jimbo', 'jimbo@ga.co', 1);

// !! note you must reference course(id) present
ga=# INSERT INTO students (name, email, course_id)
VALUES('Test', 'test@ga.co');
>> error will throw

SELECT * FROM students;
```
#### Deleting rows from a database

* We use the **Delete** keyword!
* We can be specific like SELECT!

```sql
DELETE FROM courses WHERE id = 1;

DELETE FROM courses WHERE id = 1; // if student is taking course id = 1 then this will not work
```
- if you were adding new column, it effects all the existing data, just assign default value so all other members know what to do with the new column
* What do you see?
* The error 'violates foreign key' is generated when you try to delete a row that is used as a reference in another table(students).

#### Migrations

Let's think about this. Wouldn't it be nice if we just had a script that we could copy/paste all of this into? Especially when we want to let a new user try our app out or run it on a server somewhere - having a script that can create our databses and tables for us is a *huge* win!

* We need to connect to SQL
* Create our database
* Create our tables
* How would we write this?
* Each command would be line-by-line



## Relationships in Relational Databases

### One to many

![](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/sql/images/ManyToOne.png)

One to many relationships in SQL Databases work pretty much just like **referenced** relationships. **There are NO embedded relationships in relational databses.** 

You simply put the ID of the "one" resource in the "many" as shown above. This is called a **foreign key**, because it is the key, or ID, of an item in a different table. 

### Many to Many

We didn't cover this in MongoDB because NoSQL databases are much better at storing complex data, than storing structured data with complex relationships. 

Lets dig in. 

Let's think about a high school situation where students have many classrooms and classrooms have many students. 

How do we do this? We **could** attempt to use the above (wrong) way and put ALL of the student IDs associated with each classroom in each row of the classroom table, AND ALL of the classroom IDs associated with each student in each row on the student table. 

But then we are again putting arbitrary amounts of columns in our tables and the end result is not pretty. 

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/N9sfGVpuo4p56/giphy.gif)

Fortunately the eggheads of computer science yesteryear have come up with a beautiful, elegant solution: The join table. 

#### The Join Table! (only way for sql to many to many is have another course table: 1. student, 2. course, 3. studentCourseEnrollment)
- we can have 
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/jDiUeDQpIkGIM/giphy.gif)

![](https://smehrozalam.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/erd-many-to-many-2.jpg)

We use a join table! It's a table with the ID's of BOTH, thus connecting our data across databases! YAY!!!!

A join table might be JUST a join table, meaning it might have nothing but the two IDs, or it might represent something too! 

For example, the join table above represents a real thing: **enrollment**! Enrollment might have some of it's own properties, like start and stop dates. Other times, the join table might not really represent anything that has a real life analogy, and it might not need to hold any data besides the ID's. 





To migrate existing data from a previous major version of PostgreSQL run:
  brew postgresql-upgrade-database

To have launchd start postgresql now and restart at login:
  brew services start postgresql
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start

# Lab - Postgres

## Setup

1. Create a new database called `flights`, connect to it, and run the following code:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE airlines (
    id int,
    name varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    alias varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    iata varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    icao varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    callsign varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    country varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    active varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL
  );

  CREATE TABLE airports (
    id int,
    name varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    city varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    country varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    iata_faa varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    icao varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    latitude varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    longitude varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    altitude varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    utc_offset varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    dst varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    tz varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL
  );

  CREATE TABLE routes (
    airline_code varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    airline_id int DEFAULT NULL,
    origin_code varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    origin_id int DEFAULT NULL,
    dest_code varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    dest_id int DEFAULT NULL,
    codeshare varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    stops int DEFAULT NULL,
    equipment varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL
  );
  ```

1. You can check if above tables are created by running command `\dt` in your psql shell. 

2. Clone this repo and copy [airlines.csv](airlines.csv),  [airports.csv](airports.csv),  and [routes.csv](routes.csv) to your Desktop directory on your computer.

1. Run the following code, substituting your computer's username for mine.  If you're unsure of the full path, `cd` to your Desktop and `pwd`.

  ```sql
  COPY routes FROM '/Users/<your-username>/Desktop/routes.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV;
  COPY airports FROM '/Users/<your-username>/Desktop/airports.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV;
  COPY airlines FROM '/Users/<your-username>/Desktop/airlines.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV;
  ```

1. You should now have seeded three tables with flight data. Run `SELECT * FROM <table-name> LIMIT 10;` to confirm.

## Goal

1. Select airport code for airports LIKE 'John F Kennedy' or 'De Gaulle'. 
2. Select all the flights originating from 'JFK' AND going to 'CDG'.
3. Find out the NUMBER of airports in Canada.
4. Select airport names IN the following countries- Algeria, Ghana, Ethiopia, order by country.  
5. Select all the airports that airlines 'Germania' flies from.

- # Intro to Flask

### Learning Objectives:
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Write a basic Flask application.
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/intro_to_flask/edit/master/README.md

## Discussion: Commonalities


What do you think these websites have in common?

- [Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com)
- [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com)
- [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/)

They're each:

- High on user interactivity.
- Handling a large server load.

What else?

## They All Use **Flask**

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cd83cf9ee7ad51b8af4d0c4d5220f534.webp)

Some quick notes about Flask:

- It's a Python micro web framework.
- It can create and write the entire back-end in Python!
- It can do small tasks (e.g., create a microblog or spin up a simple API).
- It can do complex tasks (e.g., Pinterest's API or create a Twitter clone).

<aside class="notes">

## Virtualenv for Django
https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/intro_to_flask/blob/master/README.md

Let's also build a virtual environment. Virtual environments allow us to have multiple versions of Python on the same system so we can have different versions of both Python and the packages we are using on our computers.

- `$ mkdir flask-intro && cd flask-intro`

```
$ pip3 install virtualenv
$ virtualenv .env -p python3
$ source .env/bin/activate

- when you download the already made package from internet
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

python3 app.py  // run the server in python3
```

```
$ pip3 install virtualenv  // installing virtual environment
$ virtualenv .env -p python3 // inside of virtualenv python3
$ source .env/bin/activate // activate the environemtne!! source cmd related to bash profile


## dependencies thursday set :
> pip3 install flask flask-login flask-bcrypt peewee flask-wtf // install all dependencies now

> pip3 freeze > requirements.txt // this is like package.json Pip freeze saves the dependencies in our virtualenv to that file.

> python3 app.py // how to run your server in python3

source ~profile //I want my shell to reset, get all its variable path source profile
```

## dependencies

We'll run the Flask app like any other app.

- We need to install Flask!
 Let's also install some dependencies and save them. Django doesn't utilize a `package.json`. Instead, we just use a text file that lists all of our dependencies. Pip freeze saves the dependencies in our `virtualenv` to that file. 

```bash
$ pip3 install flask
## dependencies

> pip3 install flask flask-login flask-bcrypt peewee flask-wtf flask_cors // install all dependencies now
> pip3 freeze > requirements.txt // this is like package.json
$ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt // take what I have been installed so far added onto files
```

****when d/l from flask from internet install flask when requirements.txt flask already exist****:


If you are downloading and running a Python project, you can usually install its dependencies with 
> `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.


## Flask Syntax

How?

We just make a normal Python app.
It looks like:

inside of app.py)
```python
# Import Flask class from flask library. (Note the upper/lowercase convention.)
from flask import Flask // import the Flask obj

# Initialize an instance of the Flask class.
# This starts the website!
app = Flask(__name__)  // assigning variable called app, always pass in Flask(__name__) __name__ !!!
#  this is similar to app. use app. render from express app

# The default URL ends in / ("my-website.com/").
# Could be instead "my-website.com/about" or anything - more on this later.
@app.route('/')  // call app. root  aka decorator python concept action that function that follows it down.

# Function that returns the page: Display "Hello, World!"
def index():     // we define the index() function 
  return 'Hello, World!'

# Run the app when the program starts!
if __name__ == '__main__':  // when we fun app.py >> spin up the webserver like server.js files
    app.run(debug=True)

```


# Import Flask class from flask library. (Note the upper/lowercase convention.)
from flask import Flask

# Initialize an instance of the Flask class.
# This starts the website!
app = Flask(__name__)

# The default URL ends in / ("my-website.com/").
# Could be instead "my-website.com/about" or anything - more on this later. set up root route decorator, like app.use in express
@app.route('/')

# Function that returns the page: Display "Hello, World!"
def index():
  return 'Hello, World!'

# Run the app when the program starts!
#  if main var equal?
if __name__ == '__main__': 
    app.run(debug=True) # debug= tru we are in dev mode show me error messge

Run the app like normal:
> `python app.py`

Go to:
> `http://localhost:5000/`

You made a web app!
Let's change the string:

```python
def index():
  # The "return" determines what's displayed.
  return 'Hello, World!'
```

It's just Python — we can write any code.
- But `return` essentially just takes strings.

```python
def index():
  my_list = ["Hey", "check", "this", "out"]
  return my_list[0] # Works!
```

Conversely:

```python
def index():
  my_list = ["Hey", "check", "this", "out"]
  return my_list # WON'T WORK
```


### variables

```python
@app.route('/sayhi/<username>') # When someone goes here...
def hello(username): # Do this.
    return "Hello {}".format(username)
```


### Templates

## Jinja2

- One of the most widely used template engines for Python.
- Used in places that you might have visited already, like Instagram or NPR.

---

## Why Jinja2?

<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points:**

- Jinja2 is kind of like the engine that powers our vehicle (Flask). However, this happens behind the scenes.
- We're quickly peering behind the scenes to get an idea of what our engine can do.

- Some examples of what makes Jinja2 awesome are:
  - **Template inheritance:** You can extend templates in very efficient ways.
  - **HTML escaping:** Malicious hackers can create XSS attacks by injecting HTML code into our site where other users insert data. Jinja2 helps us avoid that.
  - **Speed and efficiency:** Jinja2 is very fast. It compiles optimized Python code.
  - **Flexibility and extensibility:** It's really easy to add our own filters and functions.
</aside>




### Making templates

```mkdir templates```
```touch templates/index.html```

- In Jinja, **templates** are rendered with double curly brackets (`{{ }}`).

- **Statements** are rendered with curly brackets and percent signs (`{% %}`).

  - A use case here is passing in logic like:  this is inside of HTML file
	```python
	{% if name == 'kevin' %}
	# Do the thing
	{% else %}
	# Do all the other things.
	```

---

- inside of app

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

@app.route('/')
def home():
  return render_template("index.html", greeting="Hello World!")
```


- template 

## Template Solution

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Shakespeare</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>{{greeting}}</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Layout

1.  create a `layout.html`

```python
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
</head>
<body>
    
    {% block content %}{% endblock %}
</body>
</html>


```

- ```{% block content %}{% endblock %}``` this is where the template will be injected into the layout

- inside of another template

```python
{% extends "layout.html" %}


{% block content %}

<h1>Hello Fred</h1>


{% endblock %}

```

  # for item in my_list:
  return my_list[0]

# put this below the route since it will look after route is passed
#  similiar to server route :id => <username>

```

Fire up that server and check it out in action!

## Activity

Now its YOUR turn to build some view function with your partner. Build out your posts and post route both extending layout content.

IF you get lost the solution code is below.. but try before you look!

**HINT**
_The functions and html will look very similar, but the posts have additional information. Check out the posts.json for the data you will be working with._

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
<br>
app.py

```py

@app.route('/posts')
@app.route('/posts/<id>')
def posts(id=None):
    with open('posts.json') as json_data:
        posts = json.load(json_data)
        if id == None:
            return render_template('posts.html', posts=posts)
        else:
            post_id = int(id)
            return render_template('post.html', post=posts[post_id])

```

posts.html

```html
{% extends "layout.html" %}

{% block content %}
<h1>Posts</h1>
{% for post in posts %}
<article class="message is-primary">
    <div class="message-header">
        <a href={{url_for('posts', id=post.id)}}>{{post.title}}</a>

# Flask Templates!

Time to build out an app in flask!

## Initial Setup

### Virtual env

```
$ git clone git@git.generalassemb.ly:sf-wdi-51/Flask-Templates.git
$ cd Flask-Templates
```

```
$ pip3 install virtualenv
$ virtualenv .env -p python3
$ source .env/bin/activate  // get into virtual environment
> pip3 install -r requirements.txt
> python3 app.py
> pip3 install flask flask-login flask-bcrypt peewee flask-wtf
> pip3 install -r requirements.txt
> pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

Most of these we will be using later on with our models lesson.

### Dependencies

```bash
flask-login
flask
flask-bcrypt
peewee
flask-wtf
```

```bash
$ pip3 install flask flask-login flask-bcrypt peewee flask-wtf
$ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

> pip3 install flask flask-login flask-bcrypt peewee flask-wtf // install all dependencies now
> pip3 freeze > requirements.txt // this is like package.json
### The App

We are going to recreate one of my favorite websites! Reddit.

in app.py:

```py
from flask import Flask, g // this for main flask
from flask import render_template, flash, redirect, url_for  // this is just for templating
import json // json file can be display


DEBUG = True
PORT = 8000

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'adkjfalj.adflja.dfnasdf.asd'  // flask requireds secret_key for inject code preventionz

@app.route('/') // this is root!!
def index():  // function is in
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=DEBUG, port=PORT)

```


compare this to express:
express:>>>>
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile('index.html')
})

flask:>>>>>
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')


Now you can run your server with..

```bash
> python3 app.py // run it on terminal
```
now flask is running 

Head to your browser and check it out!

Now that we have it up and running let's start making some templates.

## View Functions

Let's create the inital index view and break down the index function.

in App.py:

```py
@app.route('/')
def index():
    with open('subs.json') as json_data:
        subs = json.load(json_data)
        return render_template('subs.html', subs=subs) // python will go into html and put data into html subs=subs
```

Now we need to create a template folder and our first 2 templates.

```bash
mkdir templates && cd templates  // we already did this earier!
touch layout.html subs.html 
```

In layout.html:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bulma/0.7.4/css/bulma.css"  // another css bulma frame work
    />
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/static/style.css" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <nav class="navbar is-dark" role="navigation" aria-label="main navigation">
      <div class="navbar-brand">
        <a class="navbar-item " href="{{url_for('index')}}">
          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/sdO8tAw.png" width="50" height="100" />
          <h3>Redd</h3>
        </a>
        <a
          role="button"
          class="navbar-burger burger"
          aria-label="menu"
          aria-expanded="false"
          data-target="navbarBasicExample"
        >
          <span aria-hidden="true"></span>
          <span aria-hidden="true"></span>
          <span aria-hidden="true"></span>
        </a>
      </div>

      <div id="navbarBasicExample" class="navbar-menu">
        <div class="navbar-start">
          <a class="navbar-item">
            Welcome
          </a>
        </div>

        <div class="navbar-end">
          <div class="navbar-item">
            <div class="buttons">
              <a class="button is-light" href="" title="login">Login</a>
              <a class="button is-primary" href="" title="register">
              <strong>Sign up</strong></a>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </nav>
    <br />
    <div class="columns">
      <div class="column">
        {% block content %}  // <= we can do something in here!! Flask  create a file to send : html will call this html file will call layout > 
        
        {% endblock %}
      </div>
      <div class="column"></div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

This is going to server as our main page as we swap between different templates. notice the **{% block content%}** section. This location is where our templates will appear.

In subs.html:

```html
{% extends "layout.html" %}  // i am extend to html

{% block content %}
// anything below will go into that layout .html 
<h1>Subs</h1>
{% for sub in subs %}  // we have repeating structure name, description loop for in, interject with sub.name like react everypost in city, post.title, post.image
<article class="message is-dark">
  <div class="message-header">
    <a>{{sub.name}}</a>
  </div>
  <div class="message-body">
    {{sub.description}}
  </div>
</article>
{% endfor %} {% endblock %}
```

Notice the **{% extends "layout.html" %}**? This is how we tell the templates to connect to the other file. Also let's take a look at our view function again...

```py
@app.route('/')
def index():
    with open('subs.json') as json_data: // json_data is a convention variable
        subs = json.load(json_data)  // here we are converting into dictionary that  python to use
        return render_template('subs.html', subs=subs)
```

As you can see we have a variable called **subs**. Inside the view function we can actually send all of our "DB subreddits" to our html page. Crazy right?!

![mind blown](https://media.giphy.com/media/SDogLD4FOZMM8/giphy.gif)

So now our html can loop through our subs and create html per sub. Amazing!

But we aren't done yet...

## View Route Params

So now we can view our sub reddits, but what about individual pages? Time for params.. kinda.

Let's take a look at how this is going to work.

In app.py:

```py

@app.route('/r')
@app.route('/r/')  
@app.route('/r/<sub>') // <sub> is variable name detail page
def r(sub=None): // by default sub is set to none, look r(sub=None) this is r function
    with open('subs.json') as json_data: // json_data is a convention variable
        subs = json.load(json_data) // here we are converting into dictionary that  python to use
        if sub == None:  // if sub is nothing send all sub info
            return render_template('subs.html', subs=subs)  // all subs, this is home page
        else:
            sub_id = int(sub)  // take the id convert integer, convert into number since it is an  array so it can look up which sub, id number of sub.json, id is index number
            return render_template('sub.html', sub=subs[sub_id])  // another sub.html,  id is index number and pass that 

```

REMBER: CSS gets cached therefore, anytime you update CSS!!


The same view function will activate for both routes requested.

Based inside the r route we can see the /r or /r/id. We can grab that variable through the url and use it to filter our reddits.

So now let's create a new file called sub.html

In sub.html:

```html
{% extends "layout.html" %} 

{% block content %}
<h1>Sub</h1>
<article class="message is-dark">
  <div class="message-header"> // just one sub here
    <a>{{sub.name}}</a>
  </div>
  <div class="message-body">
    {{sub.description}}
  </div>
</article>
{% endblock %}
```

And now we need to link the single page to the full page in our subs.html.
```python
refer to app.py)
@app.route('/r')
@app.route('/r/')
@app.route('/r/<sub>')
def r(sub=None):   // when id (0,1,2) getspassed it becomes string
    with open('subs.json') as json_data:
        subs = json.load(json_data)
        if sub == None:
            return render_template('subs.html', subs=subs)
        else:
            sub_id = int(sub)
            return render_template('sub.html', sub=subs[sub_id])
```

```html in subs.html)
{% extends "layout.html" %}

{% block content %}
<h1>Subs</h1>
{% for sub in subs %} // really {% for index in subs %} 
<article class="message is-dark">
    <div class="message-header">
        <!-- this is what is new -->
        <a href={{url_for('r', sub=sub.id)}}>{{sub.name}}</a> // !! important it is calling its function r here!!  {{url_for('r', Sub = Sub.ID) here sub is refering to index {{url_for('r', sub=sub.id)}} if {% for index in subs %} ==> {{url_for('r', sub=index.id)}}.
        // here we are passing in argument into function r, def r(sub=None): sub=index.id
    </div>
    <div class="message-body">
        {{sub.description}}  // this is code!! {{ }}
    </div>
</article>

{% endblock %}
```
Compare to REACT: we are holding things inside of state.  state passing things to component.
- Note: in app.py: render_template('subs.html', subs=subs)  // we are passing data inside of sub.html


We added into our href the link to be created and passed the id back to our view function. With this line..

```html
<a href={{url_for('r', sub=sub.id)}}>{{sub.name}}</a>  // url_for creates the url 
```

Fire up that server and check it out in action!

## Activity

Now its YOUR turn to build some view function with your partner. Build out your posts and post route both extending layout content.

IF you get lost the solution code is below.. but try before you look!

**HINT**
_The functions and html will look very similar, but the posts have additional information. Check out the posts.json for the data you will be working with._

This lesson on building models in Flask comes hot off the heels of our Flask Templates lesson. The starter code in this repo is where you should have left off in the last lesson and that's where we're going to start today.

Clone down this repo, and navigate to the `starter-code` directory in your file structure.

### Learning Objectives:
Students will be able to:
- build models in Flask with a new ORM, `peewee`
- associate models together
- include forms in frontend templates with `WTForms`
- cleaning up and refactoring a Flask application

## Overview
At the beginning of this lesson, our reddit clone uses JSON in place of a proper database to pass down data to templates. Our primary focus is replacing our JSON references with models, a database, and frontend functionality to create instances of those models.

We'll build out all the functionality for Subs and Posts together and then you'll build out the Comment model on your own as an opportunity to practice these things.

### TODO List
- We do: Build out a model for subs
  - set up the model
  - set up the routes and functions for creating a new sub
  - build out a front end for new sub forms

- We do: Build out a model for posts
  - set up the model for posts
  - relate posts to subs
  - set up the routes and functions for creating a new post
  - build out a front end for new posts and associated forms

- You do: build the model and appropriate templates for comments
  - model
  - relate comments to posts
  - build routes and functions for creating comments
  - provide a form for creating comments

-- note: git clone second argument you can name it whatever you like

## Steps for Subs:
1. Create a new `models.py` file in the project root
```python
  import datetime  // datetime object
  # peewee is a small and simple ORM, like mongoose but simpler
  from peewee import *  // peewee will give me db function, field(), tables, close()

  # We use the built in SqliteDatabase() function from peewee 
  # to save a reference to a DB file to a DATABASE variable
  DATABASE = SqliteDatabase('breddit.db') //

  # Our Sub model is pretty simple, just a name and description for now
  class Sub(Model):  // import datatime obj
    name = CharField() // charfield has size limit
    description = TextField()  // textfield as much as user wants to write

  # We initialize a connection to the DATABASE, create a table for the Sub model, 
  # and close the connection
  def initialize():  // initialize db
    DATABASE.connect() 
    DATABASE.create_tables([Sub], safe=True)
    DATABASE.close()
```

2. Our `app.py` file has a lot of useful functionality but we need to add a connection to our newly implemented Sub model. We also need to manage connections to our database manually and finally initialize the models when our app starts up.
```python
  # ...
  
  # This gains access to our models
  import models

  # ...

  # Handle requests when the come in (before) and when they complete (after)
  # when db connection request is active, send back current request of db
  @app.before_request # decoration functions app.before_request 
  def before_request():
    """Connect to the DB before each request."""
    g.db = models.DATABASE  # g object stands for global which is all the global packages.
    g.db.connect() 

  @app.after_request  # how to handle the response after_request
  def after_request():
    """Close the database connection after each request."""
    g.db.close()
    return response


  # The root route will revert back to a simpler version that just returns some text
  @app.route('/')  
  def index():
    return 'Integrating models with this route'

  # ...
  if __name__ == '__main__':
    # before our app runs we initialize a connection to the models
    models.initialize()
    app.run(debug=DEBUG, port=PORT)
```

3. The Sub model exists and is connected to our app but we're not doing anything with it. Let's give ourselves a way to create new subs. Enter WTForms.
  - add a `forms.py` file to the project
  - `forms.py` defines a class to represent our form. We add the fields we need which will eventually be used with a form builder on the frontend, a fairly common feature of frameworks like Flask, Django, Ruby on Rails, etc.
```python
  # import the tools and fields we need
  from flask_wtf import FlaskForm as Form
  from wtforms import TextField, TextAreaField, SubmitField

  # import the Sub model
  from models import Sub

  # create the class and variables to house Field definitions
  class SubForm(Form):
    name = TextField("Name this sub")
    description = TextAreaField("Add a description for the sub here")
    submit = SubmitField('Create Sub')
```

4. Our SubForm exists but we can't use it until we add it to a template.
  - create a `new_sub.html` template
  - use the form builder to render the form (if you're silently yelling about how we don't know what the `{{ form.something() }}` is, you're on the right track and we'll get there in the next step)
```python
  {% extends "layout.html" %}

  {% block content %}
    <form method="POST" action="" novalidate>
      {{ form.hidden_tag() }}

      <div>
        {{ form.name.label }}
        {{ form.name() }}
      </div>
      <div>
        {{ form.description.label }}
        {{ form.description() }}
      </div>

      {{ form.submit() }}
    </form>
  {% endblock %}
```

5. With a form on the frontend and a model in back, we're ready to put the two together.
  - add a function to our exisitng root route that sends down a reference to the form
```python
  # ...
  from forms import SubForm
  # ...

  @app.route('/')
  def index():
    # the form variable we send down to the template needs to be added here
    form = SubForm()
    return render_template("new_sub.html", title="New Sub", form=form)
```
- check that our form renders at the root route. If it doesn't, time to debug. When it does, write a commit.
- what happens when you try to submit the form?

6. Up to this point our root route has been receiving and accepting one type of HTTP request: "GET". If our form is going to work we need to modify so that "POST" requests are accepted too.
- allow the root route to accept multiple methods
```python
  # ...
  @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
  def index():
    # the form variable we send down to the template needs to be added here
    form = SubForm()
    return render_template("new_sub.html", title="New Sub", form=form)
```

7. Now let's handle that POST request:
```python
  @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
  def index():
    form = SubForm()
    # checks if the form submission is valid
    if form.validate_on_submit():
      # if it is, we create a new Sub
      models.Sub.create(name=form.name.data.strip(), description=form.description.data.strip())

      flash("New sub registered. Called: {}".format(form.name.data))
      # and redirect to the main Sub index
      return redirect('/r')
      
    # if the submission isn't valid, send the user back to the original view
    return render_template('new_sub.html', title="New Sub", form=form)
```

8. Now we're going to modify our `/r` routes to grab and pass down all created Subs to the frontend.
```python
  @app.route('/r')
  @app.route('/r/<sub>')
  def r(sub=None):
    # gets all subs up to a limit of 100
    subs = models.Sub.select().limit(100)
    
    # sends those subs down to the template
    return render_template("subs.html", subs=subs)
```
- This is great but if we visit `/r/1` we still see more subs than we need to. Let's fix that.

9. Modify the same function to display a single Sub '/r/<id>'

```python
  @app.route('/r')
  @app.route('/r/<sub>')
  def r(sub=None):
    if sub == None:
      subs = models.Sub.select().limit(100)
      return render_template("subs.html", subs=subs)
    else:
      # Find the right Sub
      sub_id = int(sub)
      sub = models.Sub.get(models.Sub.id == sub_id)
      # Send the found Sub to the template
      return render_template("sub.html", sub=sub)
```

## Steps for Posts:
1. Here we set up a new model in our already existing file but this time let's tie it to a Sub using the ForeignKeyField(). We'll also need to add the Post model to the initialize method.
```python
  # ...

  class Post(Model):
    timestamp = DateTimeField(default=datetime.datetime.now)
    user = CharField()
    title = CharField()
    text = TextField()
    # relate the Post model to the Sub model
    sub = ForeignKeyField(Sub, backref="posts") 

    class Meta:
      database = DATABASE
      order_by = ('-timestamp',)

  def initialize():
    DATABASE.connect()
    DATABASE.create_tables([Sub, Post], safe=True)
    DATABASE.close()
```

2. This is review but here we add a new Form definition to the forms file
```python
  # ...

  class PostForm(Form):
    user = TextField("By:")
    title = TextField("Title")
    text = TextAreaField("Content")
    submit = SubmitField('Create Post')
```

3. Here we return to the form builder. Where will the `sub.html` template get the `{{ form }}` object from? We add the form here because our users should be able to add a post within the sub they're already visiting.
```
  # sub.html
  # ...
      <section>
          <h2>Add a Post to this Sub</h2>
          <form method="POST" action="" novalidate>
              {{ form.hidden_tag() }}

              <div>
              {{ form.title.label }}
              {{ form.title() }}
              </div>
              <div>
              {{ form.text.label }}
              {{ form.text() }}
              </div>
              <div>
              {{ form.user.label("Post By:") }}
              {{ form.user() }}
              </div>

              {{ form.submit() }}
          </form>
      </section>
  {% endblock %}
```

4. Let's wrap up the connection between our template and the Post model. This will be a multi step process.
  - The form should create a new post
  ```python
    # ...

    # Find the right Sub
    sub_id = int(sub)
    sub = models.Sub.get(models.Sub.id == sub_id)
    
    # Define the form for Posts
    form = PostForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
      models.Post.create(
        user=form.user.data.strip(),
        title=form.title.data.strip(), 
        text=form.text.data.strip(), 
        sub=sub)

      flash("New post created")
      # Redirect back to the subreddit where the post was created
      return redirect("/r/{}".format(sub_id))

    return render_template("sub.html", sub=sub, form=form)
  ```

  - any existing posts should show on `sub.html` the page, so select them from the db and pass to render_template()
  ```
    {% if posts %}
      <h1>Post List</h1>
      {% for post in posts %}
      <article class="message is-primary">
          <div class="message-header">
              <a href={{url_for('posts', id=post.id)}}>{{post.title}}</a>

              <p>By: {{post.user}}</p>
          </div>
          <div class="message-body">
              {{post.text}}
          </div>
          <a>r/{{post.sub}}</a>
      </article>
      {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}
  ```

  - find exisitng posts and pass them down to the template
  ```python
    @app.route('/r')
    @app.route('/r/<sub>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def r(sub=None):
      if sub == None:
        subs = models.Sub.select().limit(100)
        return render_template("subs.html", subs=subs)
      else:
        # Find the right Sub
        sub_id = int(sub)
        sub = models.Sub.get(models.Sub.id == sub_id)
+        posts = sub.posts
        
        # Define the form for Posts
        form = PostForm()
        if form.validate_on_submit():
          models.Post.create(
            user=form.user.data.strip(),
            title=form.title.data.strip(), 
            text=form.text.data.strip(), 
            sub=sub)

          flash("New post created")
          return redirect("/r/{}".format(sub_id))
+        return render_template("sub.html", sub=sub, posts=posts, form=form)
  ```

  - posts should link to the single post page and the posts list page probably shouldn't error out
  ```python
    # ...
    @app.route('/posts')
    @app.route('/posts/<id>')
    def posts(id=None):
        if id == None:
          posts = models.Post.select().limit(100)
          return render_template('posts.html', posts=posts)
        else:
          post_id = int(id)
          post = models.Post.get(models.Post.id == post_id)
          return render_template('post.html', post=post)
    # ...
  ```

## You Do: Comments on Posts
Here are some guidelines to follow as you build out the Comments for this project:
1. Define a model and connect it to the Post model
2. Add a comment form to the other form classes
3. Add a reference to your new form to the appropriate function in `app.py`. Comments should be attached to posts so think about where this form reference should be.
4. When a user goes to an individual Post page, list out the comments

## Stretch Goals
- add the ability to delete comments, posts, and subs
- allow a user to show and hide lists of comments in posts
- allow a user to attach an image to their post (just URL)


# Flask Models

  - model
  - relate comments to posts

## Steps for Subs:
1. Create a new `models.py` file in the project root

  import datetime
  # peewee is a small and simple ORM, like mongoose but simpler
  from peewee import *

  # We use the built in SqliteDatabase() function from peewee 
  # to save a reference to a DB file to a DATABASE variable
  DATABASE = SqliteDatabase('breddit.db')

    g.db.close()
    return response


  # The root route will revert back to a simpler version that just returns some text
  @app.route('/')
  def index():
    return 'Integrating models with this route'

  # ...
  if __name__ == '__main__':
    # before our app runs we initialize a connection to the models
    models.initialize()
    app.run(debug=DEBUG, port=PORT)
```

3. The Sub model exists and is connected to our app but we're not doing anything with it. Let's give ourselves a way to create new subs. Enter WTForms.
  - add a `forms.py` file to the project
  - `forms.py` defines a class to represent our form. We add the fields we need which will eventually be used with a form builder on the frontend, a fairly common feature of frameworks like Flask, Django, Ruby on Rails, etc.
```python
  # import the tools and fields we need
  from flask_wtf import FlaskForm as Form
  from wtforms import TextField, TextAreaField, SubmitField

  # import the Sub model
  from models import Sub

  # create the class and variables to house Field definitions
  class SubForm(Form):
    name = TextField("Name this sub")
    description = TextAreaField("Add a description for the sub here")
    submit = SubmitField('Create Sub')
```

4. Our SubForm exists but we can't use it until we add it to a template.
  - create a `new_sub.html` template
  - use the form builder to render the form (if you're silently yelling about how we don't know what the `{{ form.something() }}` is, you're on the right track and we'll get there in the next step)
```python
  {% extends "layout.html" %}

  {% block content %}
    <form method="POST" action="" novalidate>
      {{ form.hidden_tag() }}

      <div>
        {{ form.name.label }}
        {{ form.name() }}
      </div>
      <div>
        {{ form.description.label }}
        {{ form.description() }}
      </div>

      {{ form.submit() }}
    </form>
  {% endblock %}
```

5. With a form on the frontend and a model in back, we're ready to put the two together.
  - add a function to our exisitng root route that sends down a reference to the form
```python
  # ...
  from forms import SubForm
  # ...

  @app.route('/')
  def index():
    # the form variable we send down to the template needs to be added here
    form = SubForm()
    return render_template("new_sub.html", title="New Sub", form=form)
```
- check that our form renders at the root route. If it doesn't, time to debug. When it does, write a commit.
- what happens when you try to submit the form?

6. Up to this point our root route has been receiving and accepting one type of HTTP request: "GET". If our form is going to work we need to modify so that "POST" requests are accepted too.
- allow the root route to accept multiple methods
```python
  # ...
  @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
  def index():
    # the form variable we send down to the template needs to be added here
    form = SubForm()
    return render_template("new_sub.html", title="New Sub", form=form)
```

7. Now let's handle that POST request:
```python
  @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
  def index():
    form = SubForm()
    # checks if the form submission is valid
    if form.validate_on_submit():
      # if it is, we create a new Sub
      models.Sub.create(name=form.name.data.strip(), description=form.description.data.strip())

      flash("New sub registered. Called: {}".format(form.name.data))
      # and redirect to the main Sub index
      return redirect('/r')
      
    # if the submission isn't valid, send the user back to the original view
    return render_template('new_sub.html', title="New Sub", form=form)
```

8. Now we're going to modify our `/r` routes to grab and pass down all created Subs to the frontend.
```python
  @app.route('/r')
  @app.route('/r/<sub>')
  def r(sub=None):
    # gets all subs up to a limit of 100
    subs = models.Sub.select().limit(100)
    
    # sends those subs down to the template
    return render_template("subs.html", subs=subs)
```
- This is great but if we visit `/r/1` we still see more subs than we need to. Let's fix that.

9. Modify the same function to display a single Sub '/r/<id>'

```python
  @app.route('/r')
  @app.route('/r/<sub>')
  def r(sub=None):
    if sub == None:
      subs = models.Sub.select().limit(100)
      return render_template("subs.html", subs=subs)
    else:
      # Find the right Sub
      sub_id = int(sub)
      sub = models.Sub.get(models.Sub.id == sub_id)
      # Send the found Sub to the template
      return render_template("sub.html", sub=sub)
```

## Steps for Posts:
1. Here we set up a new model in our already existing file but this time let's tie it to a Sub using the ForeignKeyField(). We'll also need to add the Post model to the initialize method.
```python
  # ...

  class Post(Model):
    timestamp = DateTimeField(default=datetime.datetime.now)
    user = CharField()
    title = CharField()
    text = TextField()
    # relate the Post model to the Sub model
    sub = ForeignKeyField(Sub, backref="posts") 

    class Meta:
      database = DATABASE
      order_by = ('-timestamp',)

  def initialize():
    DATABASE.connect()
    DATABASE.create_tables([Sub, Post], safe=True)
    DATABASE.close()
```

2. This is review but here we add a new Form definition to the forms file
```python
  # ...

  class PostForm(Form):
    user = TextField("By:")
    title = TextField("Title")
    text = TextAreaField("Content")
    submit = SubmitField('Create Post')
```

3. Here we return to the form builder. Where will the `sub.html` template get the `{{ form }}` object from? We add the form here because our users should be able to add a post within the sub they're already visiting.
```
  # sub.html
  # ...
      <section>
          <h2>Add a Post to this Sub</h2>
          <form method="POST" action="" novalidate>
              {{ form.hidden_tag() }}

              <div>
              {{ form.title.label }}
              {{ form.title() }}
              </div>
              <div>
              {{ form.text.label }}
              {{ form.text() }}
              </div>
              <div>
              {{ form.user.label("Post By:") }}
              {{ form.user() }}
              </div>

              {{ form.submit() }}
          </form>
      </section>
  {% endblock %}
```

4. Let's wrap up the connection between our template and the Post model. This will be a multi step process.
  - The form should create a new post
  ```python
    # ...

    # Find the right Sub
    sub_id = int(sub)
    sub = models.Sub.get(models.Sub.id == sub_id)
    
    # Define the form for Posts
    form = PostForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
      models.Post.create(
        user=form.user.data.strip(),
        title=form.title.data.strip(), 
        text=form.text.data.strip(), 
        sub=sub)

      flash("New post created")
      # Redirect back to the subreddit where the post was created
      return redirect("/r/{}".format(sub_id))

    return render_template("sub.html", sub=sub, form=form)
  ```

  - any existing posts should show on `sub.html` the page, so select them from the db and pass to render_template()
  ```
    {% if posts %}
      <h1>Post List</h1>
      {% for post in posts %}
      <article class="message is-primary">
          <div class="message-header">
              <a href={{url_for('posts', id=post.id)}}>{{post.title}}</a>

              <p>By: {{post.user}}</p>
          </div>
          <div class="message-body">
              {{post.text}}
          </div>
          <a>r/{{post.sub}}</a>
      </article>
      {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}
  ```

  - find exisitng posts and pass them down to the template
  ```python
    @app.route('/r')
    @app.route('/r/<sub>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def r(sub=None):
      if sub == None:
        subs = models.Sub.select().limit(100)
        return render_template("subs.html", subs=subs)
      else:
        # Find the right Sub
        sub_id = int(sub)
        sub = models.Sub.get(models.Sub.id == sub_id)
+        posts = sub.posts
        
        # Define the form for Posts
        form = PostForm()
        if form.validate_on_submit():
          models.Post.create(
            user=form.user.data.strip(),
            title=form.title.data.strip(), 
            text=form.text.data.strip(), 
            sub=sub)

          flash("New post created")
          return redirect("/r/{}".format(sub_id))
+        return render_template("sub.html", sub=sub, posts=posts, form=form)
  ```

  - posts should link to the single post page and the posts list page probably shouldn't error out
  ```python
    # ...
    @app.route('/posts')
    @app.route('/posts/<id>')
    def posts(id=None):
        if id == None:
          posts = models.Post.select().limit(100)
          return render_template('posts.html', posts=posts)
        else:
          post_id = int(id)
          post = models.Post.get(models.Post.id == post_id)
          return render_template('post.html', post=post)
    # ...
  ```

## You Do: Comments on Posts
Here are some guidelines to follow as you build out the Comments for this project:
1. Define a model and connect it to the Post model
2. Add a comment form to the other form classes
3. Add a reference to your new form to the appropriate function in `app.py`. Comments should be attached to posts so think about where this form reference should be.
4. When a user goes to an individual Post page, list out the comments

## Stretch Goals
- add the ability to delete comments, posts, and subs
- allow a user to show and hide lists of comments in posts
- allow a user to attach an image to their post (just URL)

- WTForms

The Sub model exists and is connected to our app but we're not doing anything with it. Let's give ourselves a way to create new subs. Enter WTForms.

```python
  # import the tools and fields we need
  from flask_wtf import FlaskForm as Form  // we just get FlaskForm and renaming Form wo it is easy to work with
  from wtforms import TextField, TextAreaField, SubmitField  

  # import the Sub model
  from models import Sub // access to our models you can do `import models`

  # create the class and variables to house Field definitions
  class SubForm(Form):  // field name, descrp, submit  why we need to use WTForms: handles acutal attributes of form when it does it for you
    name = TextField("Name this sub") // field to add in a name TextField("Name this sub") Field label as string definition
    description = TextAreaField("Add a description for the sub here") // TextAreaField
    submit = SubmitField('Create Sub') 
```

- now use WTform:
new_sub.html under directory template:
use the form builder to render the form (if you're silently yelling about how we don't know what the {{ form.something() }} is, you're on the right track and we'll get there in the next step)
```python
  {% extends "layout.html" %}

  {% block content %}
    <form method="POST" action="" novalidate>
      {{ form.hidden_tag() }}

      <div>
        {{ form.name.label }}
        {{ form.name() }}
      </div>
      <div>
        {{ form.description.label }}
        {{ form.description() }}
      </div>

      {{ form.submit() }}
    </form>
  {% endblock %}

first with flask we http://localhost:8000/ once we submit it redirected to http://localhost:8000/r that shows all 
```python

    subs = models.Sub.select().limit(100)
		# send the retrieved subs to our subs.html template
    return render_template("subs.html", subs=subs)
```

- Steps for Posts:
Here we set up a new model in our already existing file but this time let's tie it to a Sub using the ForeignKeyField(). We'll also need to add the Post model to the initialize method.
  # ...

  class Post(Model):
    timestamp = DateTimeField(default=datetime.datetime.now)
    user = CharField()
    title = CharField()
    text = TextField()
    # relate the Post model to the Sub model
    sub = ForeignKeyField(Sub, backref="posts") // backref= way to referring to posts, call models rather db.book than db.find, 
    // now we can to model.Sub.post

    class Meta:  // extra optins of where the db is when table is saved which is DATABASE.  extra thing: order by timestamp
      database = DATABASE  // where our model will exists in DATABASE  DATABASE = SqliteDatabase('breddit.db')
      order_by = ('-timestamp',)  // order_by timestamp

  def initialize():
    DATABASE.connect() // connect to database 
    DATABASE.create_tables([Sub, Post], safe=True)  // 
    DATABASE.close()

- we want post to be shown under `sub.html`
```html
    <section>
        <h2>Add a Post to this Sub- this is new form -</h2>
        <form method="POST" action="" novalidate>  // validate user
            {{ form.hidden_tag() }}

            <div class="field">

    # Define the form for Posts
    form = PostForm() // we will go to the top and import `from forms import SubForm, PostForm`
    if form.validate_on_submit():
    // when we create instance of form model post and sub is linked `sub=sub`,  relate to post has a relationship with comment for user
    // comment video manage that relationship not only model side, and individual instance of what model we are working of
      models.Post.create(
        user=form.user.data.strip(),  // data.strip() 
        title=form.title.data.strip(), 
        text=form.text.data.strip(), 
        sub=sub) // each indiv sub is related to each sub?

      flash("New post created")
      // once post successfully > redirect to the post by .format()
      return redirect("/r/{}".format(sub_id))  // "/r/{}" this is a .format(sub_id) 
    // send our found sub to the template
    return render_template("sub.html", sub=sub, posts=posts, form=form)
```

models.py)
class Post(Model):
  timestamp = DateTimeField(default=datetime.datetime.now)
  user = CharField()
  title = CharField()
  text = TextField()
  sub = ForeignKeyField(Sub, backref="posts") 

app.py)
@app.route('/r')
@app.route('/r/<sub>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def r(sub=None):
  if sub == None:
    subs = models.Sub.select().limit(100)
    return render_template("subs.html", subs=subs)
  else:
    # Find the right Sub
    sub_id = int(sub)
    sub = models.Sub.get(models.Sub.id == sub_id)
    posts = sub.posts // sub.posts represents sub = ForeignKeyField(Sub, backref="posts")  allow that relationship to exist
    
    # Define the form for Posts
    form = PostForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
      models.Post.create(
        user=form.user.data.strip(),
        title=form.title.data.strip(), 
        text=form.text.data.strip(), 
        sub=sub)

      flash("New post created")
      return redirect("/r/{}".format(sub_id))
    return render_template("sub.html", sub=sub, posts=posts, form=form)

- relationship comments and post are same sub and 

1) define model , make the connection btwn 
2) add comment form.py file (along with clssess)
3) reference the form (work with /posts route), removing json data
4) if user navigates to /subreddit/
you can make it 
tomorrow is apis.

################ flask api friday lesson
## Flask API

We are going to create a basic api that performs all crud routes using Flask

- Create a new directory `mkdir flask-api`. 
- Now run `cd flask-api`.
- Run command `touch app.py models.py requirements.txt`

#### Setup virtualenv

- inside flask-api-dogs folder

```bash
virtualenv .env -p python3  // start the virtual environment this is creating only do this once
source .env/bin/activate  // env is a folder that all the stuff will be store under, anytime you close your terminal you have restart the vitualenv
```

#### Dependencies

```
pip3 install flask flask_cors flask-marshmallow flask-sqlalchemy marshmallow-sqlalchemy  // flask-marshmallow is for rest call, flask-sqlalchemy used to ORM like help you with talk to models, marshmallow-sqlalchemy will talk to eachother
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt  // like package json
> code .
```

why we say `pip3` not `pip`?? b/c pip3 is for python3


### Setup basic server 


```python
import os

from flask import Flask  // get the library

app = Flask(__name__) // environment variable hold the value of main gets saved, `__name__` is sset by Flask App

DEBUG = True  // Run your flask app in dev environment, when I run the server app.py any error will show up
PORT = 8000  // every server have PORT number, comment practice give separate pork

@app.route('/')  // @app << any starting with @* anything def following is the route: it is decorator, aka annotations
def hello_world():  // a simple string hello_world route
    return 'Hello World'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=DEBUG, port=PORT)  // debug=DEBUG <= dev environment, port=PORT <= set my port
```

>8000 is the port number that your app will run on

Test everything bu running `python3 app.py` on terminal and then execute this [link](http://localhost:8000). You should get 'Hello World' in reponse.

Now initialize the databse object using SqlAlchemy:

### Database setup using SqlAlchemy

SqlAlchemy is an ORM used in Flask to connect and communicate with the database.

####app.py

```python
import os  // python class access environment variable, os will get you the direcotry with followint > `basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))`

from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_marshmallow import Marshmallow

# Set Base Directory
// our database set should be in the current folder it is in, SQlite is serverless (you don't have to run a server), postgres - that is server you have to run a server anywhere your system, Mongodb you run server first than db, sQlite doesn't need additional server SQlite  creates  current folder please create db folder, sqlite you create table, like anything, you get simple table, indexing primary keys, you will additionally use postgress to run the database
> basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))

# Setup Database
// os.path.join(basedir, 'db.reddit') we are saving db in my current directory we are in os.path.join(basedir,: 'db.reddit') =>> name of the app name 'db.reddit', os.path.join(where should I save my db?, 'db.NAmeof my database') 
> app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///' + os.path.join(basedir, 'db.reddit')  
> app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False

# Init Database
// db object set it to SQLAlchemy
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

#Init Marshmallow
marshmallow = Marshmallow(app)

DEBUG = True
PORT = 8000

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=DEBUG, port=PORT)

```
> db.reddit is the db name.

Run your app using `python3 app.py` again to confirm that there are no errors. 

### Sub

Let's create our first model for our app in `models.py`.

#### models.py

```python
from app import db, marshmallow
from flask import jsonify  // not in the note make sure you import this!!

class Sub(db.Model): // here we are inheriting Sub has extra abilities, create table Sub in my db, 3 columns( id, name, description )
	  __table_args__ = {'extend_existing': True} 
	 
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)  // .create sub sqlalchemy auto generation of our key, we have to mention the primary_key=True
    name = db.Column(db.String(100))  // db.Column(db.String(100) << 100 as limit character for name
    description = db.Column(db.String(300))  // you can give default values here default=value 0

    def __init__(self, name, description):  // init is constructor (self, name, description) name will be auto generated
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
        

if __name__ == 'models': // name is enviromnt variable that which file you are in currently
    db.create_all() // similiar toe class meta initializer yesterday simliary for sql alchemy
```
> When True, indicates that if this Table is already present in the given MetaData, apply further arguments within the constructor to the existing Table.

### Schema setup using Marshmallow

You can use this library to dictate what fields will be sent back to the user in response.

Using Marshmallow let's add sub schema in `models.py`.

```python
class SubSchema(marshmallow.Schema):  
  class Meta:  // this is Meta class: flask Django of doing thing
    fields = ('id', 'name', 'description')  // I need name description we aer using marshmallow to set our user, call the 

sub_schema = SubSchema(strict=True)  // create variable sub_schema - you have to enforce all validataion strict=True, any empty value it will force user to fill it out.
subs_schema = SubSchema(many=True, strict=True)  // if I want multiple returns `many=True`
```

Now let's add create and get methods for Sub model in `models.py`

- summayr: so far I created a db
  this Sub create_sub we are insert into db SQalchemy 1) create db.session > than commit() the data 
  SQL:automacity of db, all work or none,  
            db.session.add(new_sub)  // I am creating db session to create new_sub obj in my table 
            db.session.commit()  // commit is saving to db.

```python
class Sub(db.Model):
    __table_args__ = {'extend_existing': True} 

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True)
    description = db.Column(db.String(300))

    def __init__(self, name, description):  // constructor I defined
        self.name = name  
        self.description = description

    @classmethod
    def create_sub(cls, name, description):
        new_sub = Sub(name, description)
        try:
            db.session.add(new_sub)  // 1) creating db session to create new_sub obj in my table 
            db.session.commit()  // I am running commit on it, commit is saving to db. we are commit data into your db, when you call commit() data persist in your db (sqlAlchemy)
        except:
            db.session.rollback()
            raise Exception('Session rollback')
        return sub_schema.jsonify(new_sub)  // I created sub_schema in conver into json obj nd send it back to user

    @classmethod
    def get_sub(cls, subid):
        sub = Sub.query.get(subid)  // run the query from Sub model 
        return sub_schema.jsonify(sub) // created sub_schema in conver into json obj nd get back from your database
        
class SubSchema(marshmallow.Schema):
  class Meta:
    fields = ('id', 'name', 'description')

sub_schema = SubSchema(strict=True)
subs_schema = SubSchema(many=True, strict=True)
```

Now, add routes for your Sub model in `app.py`.

```python
# on top
from flask import Flask, request // import request object

@app.route('/sub', methods=['POST']) // first only do POST
@app.route('/sub/<subid>', methods=['GET'])  // this is get method to receive data from db, <subid> is variable putting <>
def create_sub(subid=None):  //  subid=None defaulting it none
    from models import Sub  // import Sub from models, the reason we only get the models import Sub inside of create_sub() from model: reason is circular reference
    // inside of python, we cna only have many parents, python allows multiple inheritance
    // this is called circular dependency, deadblock: which one should I load first?  
    //  python let u have multiple inheritance: there can be a conflict

// does javascript allow multiple inheritance: no, python does allow multiple inheritance (having several parents)
// model.py has from app import db, marshmallow ghere fore you can't have from models import Sub inside app.py


    if subid == None:
        name = request.json['name']  // request object json obj
        description = request.json['description'] // request obj we are importing

        return Sub.create_sub(name, description)  // from Sub that I created from models, method from model file .create_sub() from Model, this is going to create data into your table
    else:
        return Sub.get_sub(subid)
```

Use Postman to test both routes.

### Post

Let's create a Post model such that each post has a reference to one Sub.
model..py)
```python
class Post(db.Model):  // model is inheriting from it
    __table_args__ = {'extend_existing': True}  // table refresh everytime

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)  // primarykey gets autoimplemented
    timestamp = db.Column(db.DateTime())  // this is current time note: you can add defaut value: current value
    user = db.Column(db.String(100))  // user, title, text, sub 
    title = db.Column(db.String(200))
    text = db.Column(db.String(500))
    sub = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("sub.id"))  // sub reference to your id in your sub table this is the relational

    def __init__(self, user, title, text, sub):  // __init__ starts things up
        self.user = user
        self.title = title
        self.text = text
        self.sub = sub

    @classmethod
    def create_post(cls, user, title, text, sub): // first thing to do initialize the constructor  ==> new_post = Post(user, title, text, sub)
        new_post = Post(user, title, text, sub)  
        try:
            db.session.add(new_post)  // no issue then add
            db.session.commit()  // if there no error it will save data
        except:
            db.session.rollback()  // if error catch will come on
            raise  // js we say throw error here we use raise

        return post_schema.jsonify(new_post)  //  make it json

    @classmethod
    def get_post(cls,post_id):
        post = Post.query.get(post_id)
        return post_schema.jsonify(post)
``` 

next, we create the Schema inside of model.py)

```python
class PostSchema(marshmallow.Schema):
  class Meta:
    fields = ('id', 'user', 'title', 'text', 'sub')

# Init Schema
post_schema = PostSchema(strict=True)
posts_schema = PostSchema(many=True, strict=True)
```

```python
@app.route('/post', methods=['POST']) // when you go to /post you will be posting
@app.route('/post/<postid>', methods=['GET'])  
def get_or_create_post(postid=None):
    from models import Post
    if postid == None:  // this is POST
        user = request.json['user']
        title = request.json['title']
        text = request.json['text']
        sub = request.json['sub']

        return Post.create_post(user, title, text, sub)
    else:
        return Post.get_post(postid)
```

## You Do: Comments on Posts

Here are some guidelines to follow as you build out routes for Comments for this project:

- Define a Comment model and connect it to the Post model
- Create a post and get methods in the model
- Create the schema for Comment
- Add routes in `app.py` to either get or post comments

- https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/flask-api/edit/master/README.md

## When you are running your app in postman how to run POSTMAN POST method using json:
--- models.py)
class Sub(db.Model):
  __table_args__ = {'extend_existing': True}

  id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
  name = db.Column(db.String(100))
  description = db.Column(db.String(300))

  def __init__(self, name, description):
    self.name = name
    self.description = description

  @classmethod
  def create_sub(cls, name, description):  // I am using this method to do a Post method
    new_sub = Sub(name, description)
    try:
      db.session.add(new_sub)
      db.session.commit()
    except:
      db.session.rollback()
      raise Exception('Session rollback')
    return sub_schema.jsonify(new_sub)

if __name__ == 'models':  // we make 
  db.create_all()

---- app.py) // server folder 
@app.route('/sub', methods=['POST'])
@app.route('/sub/<subid>', methods=['GET'])
def create_sub(subid=None):
  from models import Sub // here we are importing from Sub model
  if subid == None:
    name = request.json['name']
    description = request.json['description']

    return Sub.create_sub(name, description) // Sub.create_sub <== we are required to input name, description
  else: 
    return Sub.get_sub(subid)

  - POST > http://localhost:8000/sub > Change to BODY tab > raw > JSON(application/json)
    {
      "name": "Heggy",
      "description": "funfriday"
    }

    => req.body will output: 
    {
      "description": "funfriday",
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Heggy"
    }

###  multiple get all method: models.py)

from app import db, marshmallow
from flask import jsonify

class Sub(db.Model):
  __table_args__ = {'extend_existing': True}

  id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
  name = db.Column(db.String(100))
  description = db.Column(db.String(300))

  def __init__(self, name, description):
    self.name = name
    self.description = description
  
  @classmethod
  def get_or_create_sub(cls, name, description):
    new_sub = Sub(name, description)
    try:
      db.session.add(new_sub)
      db.session.commit()
    except:
      db.session.rollback()
      raise Exception('Session rollback')
    return sub_schema.jsonify(new_sub)

  @classmethod
  def get_sub(cls, subid):
    sub = Sub.query.get(subid)
    return sub_schema.jsonify(sub)

# get multiple 
  @classmethod
  def get_subs(cls):
    sub = Sub.query.all() #many equal to tru: use subs!! we are getting all 
    return subs_schema.jsonify(subs)

class SubSchema(marshmallow.Schema):
  class Meta:
    fields = ('id', 'name', 'description')

sub_schema = SubSchema(strict=True)
subs_schema = SubSchema(many=True, strict=True)


if __name__ == 'models':
  db.create_all()


### Note about rollback for sqlDB:

  @classmethod
  def get_or_create_sub(cls, name, description):
    new_sub = Sub(name, description)
    # db.session.add(new_sub) # these 2 lines show 
    # db.session.commit()
    #  sometimes query when there is problem with session everytime you access your database, you roll back  do this for every database, SqlDB any integrity of your data, it will try to save your data in your table
    try:
      db.session.add(new_sub)
      db.session.commit()
    # when there is a exception problem with your db it will close the error session (session.rollback()) it will go back to the previous session state so next user can see the fresh session that has no error session rollback() you can use it for any query update db, delete db: any db that modifies the db
    except:
      db.session.rollback()
      raise Exception('Session rollback')
    return sub_schema.jsonify(new_sub)


test: your app 
800/post
 body raw json > {
  "user":"test"
  "title":"tesitng"
  "text":"more testing"
  "sub": 1
 }

http://localhost:8000/post
get all 
 - if you want to view flask-sqlalchemy  then use app `DB Browser for SQLite` for flask-sqlalchemy db
 1) go to `DB Browser for SQLite` app
 2) select db.reddit // get the database
 here is how it looks when you are opening the db

  locally changing the variable
  x = 'inside'
  print('x = ')
  # x locally now inside
  return x 
print('report(): ')
print(report(x))
print('global x ', x)
```

- note oop:

<!-- initialize the class  -->
  def__init__(self, param1, param2):
    self.param1 = param1
    self.param2 = param2
  
  def some_method(self): # self keyword is like this keyword
    # perform some action
    print(self.parm1)

```python
mylist = [1,2,3]

mylist.append(4)

class Sample():
  pass # doesn't do anything

x = Sample()
print(type(x))
# => <class '__main__.Sample'> we created own Obj type Sample obj type like list type or number type

```

### next concept:
- attribute for object class
```python
# Dog obj
class Dog(): 
  def __int__(self, input_breed): 
    self.breed = input_breed
# __int__ this us dunder methods 

# when we call the class > we will call the __init__ method > pass self keyword becomes x
# self(x).breed is what we passed in as input_breed (Huskie)
x = Dog(input_breed='Huskie')

print(type(x))
print(x.breed)  => Huskie

```
```python
# Dog obj
class Dog(): 
  def __int__(self, input_breed, input_name): 
    self.breed = input_breed
    self.name = input_name
# __int__ this us dunder methods 

# when we call the class > we will call the __init__ method > pass self keyword becomes x
# self(x).breed is what we passed in as input_breed (Huskie)
x = Dog(input_breed='Huskie', input_name='Sammy')


print(type(x))
print(x.breed)  => Huskie

```
Let's do a right syntax
```python
class Dog():
  def __init__(self, breed):
    self.breed = breed
  
x = Dog('Huskie')
print(type(x))  # <class '__main__.Dog'>
print(x.breed) # Huskie


class Dog():
  def __init__(self, breed, name):
    self.breed = breed
    self.name = name
  
shine = Dog('Huskie', 'Shine')
print(type(shine))  # <class '__main__.Dog'>
print(shine.breed)
print(shine.name) # Huskie

class Dog():

  # Class Object Attributes: overall characteristic of the class beyond individual user it has shine, same
  species = 'mammal'
  def __init__(self, breed, name):
    self.breed = breed
    self.name = name
  
shine = Dog('Huskie', 'Shine')
print(type(shine))  # <class '__main__.Dog'>
print(shine.breed)
print(shine.name) # Huskie
print(shine.species) # mammal due to Class Obj Atrrib

class Circle():
  def __init__(self, radius=1):
    self.radius = radius

mycircle = Circle()
print(mycircle.radius)
# => 1

class Circle():
  def __init__(self, radius=1):
    self.radius = radius

mycircle = Circle(10)
print(mycircle.radius)
# => 10

class Circle():
  # Class Object Attributes:
  pi = 3.14
  def __init__(self, radius=1):
    self.radius = radius

  # pass in self to let pythong know you are creating an instance of obj itself when applying this method
  def area(self):
    return self.pi * self.radius * self.radius

  def circumference(self):
    return 2 * self.radius * self.pi

mycircle = Circle(10)
print(mycircle.radius)
print(mycircle.area())
print(mycircle.circumference())

### inheritance
class Animal():
  
  def __init__(self):
    print('Animal Created!')

  def report(self):
    print("Animal")
  
  def eat(self):
    print('Eating!!')

a = Animal()
a.eat()
a.report()
# Animal Created!
# Eating!!
# Animal

class Animal():
  
  def __init__(self):
    print('Animal Created!')

  def report(self):
    print("Animal")
  
  def eat(self):
    print('Eating!!')

class Dog(Animal):
  
  def __init__(self):
    # create instance of Animla class
    Animal.__init__(self)
    print("Dog Created") 

# create an instance of dog class
d = Dog()
# => Animal Created! (first Animal())
# => Dog Created  (inside of print Dog)
d.eat() 

class Animal():
  
  def __init__(self):
    print('Animal Created!')

  def report(self):
    print("Animal")
  
  def eat(self):
    print('Eating!!')

class Dog(Animal):
  
  def __init__(self):
    # create instance of Animla class
    Animal.__init__(self)
    print("Dog Created") 

# create an instance of dog class
d = Dog()
# => Animal Created! (first Animal())
# => Dog Created  (inside of print Dog)
d.eat()
# => Eating!! (inherit from Animal class b/c Animal.__init__(self))
d.report()
```
Being able use methods or attributes already defined in another class with a new class

- over writing method inside of Dog(Animal)
```python
class Animal():
  
  def __init__(self):
    print('Animal Created!')

  def report(self):
    print("Animal")
  
  def eat(self):
    print('Eating!!')

class Dog(Animal):
  
  def __init__(self):
    # create instance of Animla class
    Animal.__init__(self)
    print("Dog Created") 
  
  # over-wrting method with same name
  def report(self):
    print("I am a dog!")

# create an instance of dog class
d = Dog()
# => Animal Created! (first Animal())
# => Dog Created  (inside of print Dog)
d.eat()
# => Eating!! (inherit from Animal class b/c Animal.__init__(self))
d.report()

######### if parent class has more argument how to use that inside child??

class Animal():
  # note init method requires self, fur
  def __init__(self, fur):
    self.fur = fur

  def report(self):
    print("Animal")
  
  def eat(self):
    print('Eating!!')

class Dog(Animal):
  # start your init method also pass in what parent passed in
  def __init__(self, fur):
    # remeber to pass self, fur inside here
    Animal.__init__(self, fur)
    print("Dog Created")

    # over-wrting method with same name
  def report(self):
    print("I am a dog!")
# create an instance of dog class
# now we need to pass in fur argument def __init__(self, fur):
  # create instance of Animla class
  # Animal.__init__(self, fur)
d = Dog('fuzzy')

# how to call the new argument? fur type fuzzy as a attribute
print(d.fur)

```
term: class Animal(): is base class
class Dog(Animal): is derived class

## Overview

###### What is this project?

For the second project, you will use your knowledge of front-end and back-end web development to produce a polished web application that can be used by friends, family, or the wider online community -- and that will benefit your portfolio.

**The objective of this project is to:**

* Work with a group in a shared GitHub repository.
* Plan and implement a larger scale project as part of a development team.
* Integrate topics learned and experience gained in the course so far.
* Showcase your abilities to potential employers, friends, family, and community members.

**You will be working in groups of 4 for this project.**

---

## Planning & Deliverables

###### What will we be turning in?

### Project Planning Deliverables

**You must review the following with your instructional team BEFORE you start to code.**

* **Scope:** What are you planning to build? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?
* **User Stories:** Who is your user? What features will your app have? Set up your project and user stories in <a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a> or in some other organized format.
* **Wireframes:** Sketch out what your core pages will look like and how they will work. Consider making a *paper prototype* to demonstrate and/or test key user interactions.
* **Data Models:** Draw out the models and any associations for your project in an entity relationship diagram (ERD). Keep in mind this project will use a relational, PostgreSQL database
* **Milestones:** Outline the milestones/sprints for your group.
* **Delegating Tasks:** What will each group member work on? Leverage everyone's strengths, and spend the majority of coding time pair programming.

### Completed Project Deliverables

* Link to Heroku hosted project, with all core technical requirements and three flexible technical requirements complete.
* Link to source code on GitHub.
* A `README.md` file with the following:
  * Description: Short paragraph (2-3 sentences) "elevator pitch" describing what your project does
  * Wireframes and user stories
  * Link to Heroku hosted project
  * Technologies (languages, external libraries, APIs)
  * Wish List / Future Development
  * Contributors (with links to their GitHub profiles)

---

## Technical Requirements

###### What technologies will we be using?

### Core Technical Requirements

**Your app should have all of the following:**

* **Flask:** Use Flask as the core framework for Python.
* **PostgreSQL:** Use PostgreSQL for your database in development and production.
* **Data Models** Include at least two data models with associations.
* **Data Validation:** Your application should validate incoming data before entering it into the database.
* **Error Handling:** Forms in your application should also validate data, handle incorrect inputs, and provide user feedback on the client side.
* **Views:** Use **Jinja templates**.
* **Home & About Pages:** Create a landing page (homepage) that clearly explains your app's value proposition and guides the user through the "get started" funnel. Create an about page that includes photos and brief bios of your team members.
* **User Experience:** Ensure a pleasing and logical user experience. Use a framework like Bootstrap, Bulma, or Skeleton to enhance and ease your CSS styling.
* **Responsive Design:** Make sure your app looks great on a phone or tablet.
* **Heroku:** Deploy your app to Heroku. Ensure no app secrets are exposed. *Do not commit secret keys to GitHub!*
    - instantiate your own file since it won't know the to go to requirement.txt file (ask for help)
### Flexible Technical Requirements

**Your app should have 3 out of the 5 following options:**

* **User Login** Make sure you have authentication *and* authorization.
* **AJAX** Use AJAX to communicate with the server without reloading the page when appropriate.
* **External APIs** Use  a third-party API back-end package to integrate third-party data into your app.  
  - axios call in REACT
* **JavaScript & jQuery:** Add dynamic client-side behavior with event-driven functionality.
* **User-Friendly URLs:** Make pretty URLs that don't expose database IDs.  (/post/titleofPost vs /post/api/<title>)
  - if you choose React front-end , Flask back-end

---

## Further Exploration

###### What if we want to do more?

If you want to push yourself and learn something new, optionally consider doing any of the following ideas. *Please talk to an instructor beforehand.*

* **Charting:** Visualize your data! Possibilities include D3, Morris.js, Highcharts, Chart.js, and Google Charts.
* **Job Scheduling:** Set up a job-scheduler to queue actions that don't need to run immediately.  
  - data clean once per day data integry
* **Emails:** Use `flask-mail` to send emails to your users.
  - send welcome email
* **Text Messaging:** Use Twilio to send texts to your users (note: not free).
  - 
* **Payment:** Use Stripe to allow your users to purchase from or donate to your site.
  - stripe payment
* **Material Design:** Research the material design paradigm and apply it to ground your app's UI in the physical realm.
* **CSS Animations:** Use jQuery or animate.css to include animations on your site.
* **Accessibility:** Research web accessibility (e.g. for blind users), and apply accessibility principles to your app.
* **Sessions:** Use sessions to store data for site visitors (who aren't necessarily logged in).
* **Search:** Build a form that allows users to search your data, based on attributes. Consider looking into Elasticsearch to speed up queries.
* **Whatever else you can think of!**

## Project Feedback

Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Deployment: Is your project deployed to a hosting service like Heroku?

Technical Requirements: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements?

Readability: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?
  - make the code neat on Sunday night

Application Flow: Is it easy for a user to navigate through your application? Have you thought through quality-of-life improvements for your user like implementing redirects, making forms easy to navigate and nice to look at, etc.
  - redirects to place user wants to go to, pagenation?

You'll be receiving written feedback from your instructors. The criteria above will be evaluated as either incomplete, falls below expectations, meets expectations, or exceeds expectations.

- outcome

- flask Auth with Brock
option we can ue JWT flask also

# Flask Auth  https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/flask-auth **************** Flask login lesson
In this lesson we'll implement user authorization and authentication in a Flask app using the `flask_login` package. This type of auth setup uses sessions to communicate with the database and authorize a user. A session cookie is created and that validates that our user is who they say they are.

### Learning Objectives
- use the `flask_login` package
- demonstrate the differences between JWT and Session Cookies

### Virtual env
We'll start with building the foundation for our app's file structure and include a virtual environment setup.

`$ mkdir flask-with-models && cd flask-with-models`

```
$ pip3 install virtualenv
$ virtualenv .env -p python3
$ source .env/bin/activate
```

### Dependencies

```bash
flask-login
flask
flask-bcrypt
peewee
flask-wtf
```

```bash
$ pip3 install flask flask-login flask-bcrypt peewee flask-wtf
$ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

### The App

We are going to create a twitter like feed where a user will be able to login and logout, as well as create posts that will be displayed in a feed.  

## Peewee the ORM

[Peewee](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee) - *Peewee is a simple and small ORM. It has few (but expressive) concepts, making it easy to learn and intuitive to use.* from the docs

This is the ORM (Object-relational mapping) we will use to hook up to our sql databases and communicate with them. 


### Let's set up the User model

```python
# models.py

import datetime
from peewee import *

from flask_login import UserMixin
from flask_bcrypt import generate_password_hash

DATABASE = SqliteDatabase('twit.db')

class User(UserMixin, Model):
    username = CharField(unique=True)
    email = CharField(unique=True)
    password = CharField(max_length=100)
    joined_at = DateTimeField(default=datetime.datetime.now)
    is_admin = BooleanField(default=False)
    
    class Meta:
        database = DATABASE
        
    @classmethod
    def create_user(cls, username, email, password, admin=False):
        try:
            cls.create(
                username=username,
                email=email,
                password=generate_password_hash(password),
                is_admin=admin)
        except IntegrityError:
            raise ValueError("User already exists")
            
def initialize():
    DATABASE.connect()
    DATABASE.create_tables([User], safe=True)
    DATABASE.close()
```

- We are using sqlite as our database here, this is really great for development purposes to get up and running real quick, and it makes a setting up a production database, ie. Postgres, easy.

-  We are using the UserMixin here from [flask-login](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), to give our User class some default features.  Mixins are small classes that add some specific feature. Since they're not the final class that we want to extend, they go at the beginning of our inheritance chain.

- `@classmethod` - a class method knows its class, it is used to be availiable for the class and we can use it anytime instead of having to instatiate the class in order to use a method that way we can use User.create_user anywhere where are model is availiable.  `cls` is an object that holds the class itself, not an instance of the class. 

- Meta - When Python creates a class object, special construction instructions can be provided. This is done through the Meta class. In this case, the Model base class includes methods for creating and saving instances of this class to a database. This requires knowing which database to use. Since the database isn't part of the class itself, this class constructor information is provided through the special Meta class.

- The initialize method will set up our datatables, while we open and close the connection

- Now lets go to our app

```python
# app.py

from flask import Flask, g

import models

DEBUG = True
PORT = 8000

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.before_request
def before_request():
    """Connect to the database before each request."""
    g.db = models.DATABASE
    g.db.connect()


@app.after_request
def after_request(response):
    """Close the database connection after each request."""
    g.db.close()
    return response

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'hi'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    models.initialize()
    try:
        models.User.create_user(
            username='jimbo',
            email="jim@jim.com",
            password='password',
            admin=True
            )
    except ValueError:
        pass

    app.run(debug=DEBUG, port=PORT)
```

- the `g` we import at the top of the file stands for global and we are using it to set up a global access to our database throughout the app.

- when developing a web application, it’s common to open a connection when a request starts, and close it when the response is returned. You should always manage your connections explicitly. For instance, if you are using a connection pool, connections will only be recycled correctly if you call connect() and close().

We will tell flask that during the request/response cycle we need to create a connection to the database. Flask provides some useful decorators to make this easy

```python
# app.py

@app.before_request
def before_request():
    """Connect to the database before each request."""
    g.db = models.DATABASE
    g.db.connect()


@app.after_request
def after_request(response):
    """Close the database connection after each request."""
    g.db.close()
    return response
 ```
 
 ## Login Manger
 
```python
# app.py

from flask import Flask, g
from flask import render_template, flash, redirect, url_for
from flask_login import LoginManager, login_user, logout_user, login_required, current_user
from flask_bcrypt import check_password_hash


import models
import forms


DEBUG = True
PORT = 8000

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'adkjfalj.adflja.dfnasdf.asd'

login_manager = LoginManager()
## sets up our login for the app
login_manager.init_app(app)
login_manager.login_view = 'login'

@login_manager.user_loader
def load_user(userid):
    try:
        return models.User.get(models.User.id == userid)
    except models.DoesNotExist:
        return None
```

- `app.secretkey` is for the hash for our session cookie we can make up whatever random characters we'd like. By default, Flask-Login uses sessions for authentication. This means you must set the secret key on your application,

-  We can use the `LoginManager()` to handle all the login things like is_authenticated, or get id. The login manager contains the code that lets your application and Flask-Login work together, such as how to load a user from an ID, and where to send users when they need to log in.  

-  `@login_manager.user_loader` - We need to provide user_loader callback. This callback is used to reload the user object from the user ID stored in the session. It should take the unicode ID of a user, and return the corresponding user object.


### Forms

`pip install flask-wtf`

- touch `forms.py`

We are going to learn how to create forms with classes that will allow us the following features.  

1.  Integration with WTForms.
2.  Secure Form with CSRF token.
3.  Global CSRF protection.
4.  reCAPTCHA support.
5. File upload that works with Flask-Uploads.
6. Form validation

forms.py
```python 
# forms.py

from flask_wtf import FlaskForm as Form

from models import User

from wtforms import StringField, PasswordField, TextAreaField
from wtforms.validators import (DataRequired, Regexp, ValidationError, Email,
                               Length, EqualTo)


def name_exists(form, field):
    if User.select().where(User.username == field.data).exists():
        raise ValidationError('User with that name already exists.')


def email_exists(form, field):
    if User.select().where(User.email == field.data).exists():
        raise ValidationError('User with that email already exists.')

class RegisterForm(Form):
    username = StringField(
        'Username',
        validators=[
            DataRequired(),
            Regexp(
                r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$',
                message=("Username should be one word, letters, "
                         "numbers, and underscores only.")
            ),
            name_exists
        ])
    email = StringField(
        'Email',
        validators=[
            DataRequired(),
            Email(),
            email_exists
        ])
    password = PasswordField(
        'Password',
        validators=[
            DataRequired(),
            Length(min=2),
            EqualTo('password2', message='Passwords must match')
        ])
    password2 = PasswordField(
        'Confirm Password',
        validators=[DataRequired()]
    )
 ```

- Validators will allow us to check if it is in the database, and make sure the form is filled out property. 
- The first argument to each field is the label for the form.  

*ok now lets set up the view 

```python
# app.py

@app.route('/register', methods=('GET', 'POST'))
def register():
    form = forms.RegisterForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        flash('Yay you registered', 'success')
        models.User.create_user(
            username=form.username.data,
            email=form.email.data,
            password=form.password.data
            )

        return redirect(url_for('index'))
    return render_template('register.html', form=form)
```

- What's cool here is that we can set up one route here to handle both the Get and the Post.
- the return for the if is on a successful post request, (form.validate_on_submit() returns a boolean)
- the return with the render template returns the the form for the get request

```html
<!-- templates/register.html -->

<form method="POST" action="" class="form">
    {{ form.hidden_tag() }}
    {% for field in form %}
        <div class="field">
            {% if field.errors %}
                {% for error in field.errors %}
                    <div class="notification error">{{ error }}</div>
                {% endfor %}
            {% endif %}
            {{ field(placeholder=field.label.text) }}
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
    <button type="submit" id="submit">Register!</button>
</form>
```

- The form.hidden_tag contains our csrf token.  The rest of this is just generating our form from the form class we are injecting into the template from our view.  `return render_template('register.html', form=form)`

- go ahead and test it out.

### Macros

- So you can probably imagine we will have to render out the form like we did above over and over again, and were programmers and we are pretty lazy, wouldn't it be nice to have a function that does that for us.  Here come macros 

- `{% macro %}`: A function in a template to repeat code on demand. Often really useful for things like form fields.

```html
<!-- templates/macros.html -->

{% macro render_field(field) %}
    <div class="field">
        {% if field.errors %}
            {% for error in field.errors %}
                <div class="notification error">{{ error }}</div>
            {% endfor %}
        {% endif %}
        {{ field(placeholder=field.label.text) }}
    </div>
{% endmacro %}
```

- here we are defining a macro called `render_field(field)` that accepts a form field as an argument and renders out the placeholder and field errors, we can then refactor our register form to look like the following

```html
<!-- templates/register.html -->

{% from 'macros.html' import render_field %}

<form method="POST" action="" class="form">
    {{ form.hidden_tag() }}
    {% for field in form %}
        {{ render_field(field) }}
    {% endfor %}
    <button type="submit" id="submit">Register!</button>
</form>
```


### Login 
- so lets set up login its going to be very similiar to register 
- build a class to represent the form
```python
# forms.py
# ...

class LoginForm(Form):
    email = StringField('Email', validators=[DataRequired(), Email()])
    password = PasswordField('Password', validators=[DataRequired()])
```

- build out a login route and behaviour
```python
# app.py
# ...

@app.route('/login', methods=('GET', 'POST'))
def login():
    form = forms.LoginForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        try:
            user = models.User.get(models.User.email == form.email.data)
        except models.DoesNotExist:
            flash("your email or password doesn't match", "error")
        else:
            if check_password_hash(user.password, form.password.data):
                ## creates session
                login_user(user)
                flash("You've been logged in", "success")
                return redirect(url_for('index'))
            else:
                flash("your email or password doesn't match", "error")
    return render_template('login.html', form=form)

# ...
```

- You'll see here we are using `login_user(user)`, a method from `flask_login`, to set our session.
- finally we'll build a template using our form macro to outpul all appropriate fields

```html
<!-- templates/login.html -->
{% from 'macros.html' import render_field %}

<form method="POST" action="" class="form">
    {{ form.hidden_tag() }}
    {% for field in form %}
        {{ render_field(field) }}
    {% endfor %}
    <button type="submit" id="submit">Login!</button>
</form>
```

- go ahead and try it out!

### Logout
Next let's handle the process for logging a user out.

```python
# app.py
# ...

@app.route('/logout')
@login_required
def logout():
    logout_user()
    flash("You've been logged out", "success")
    return redirect(url_for('index'))

# ...
```

- `logout_user()`: Method to delete the user's session provided by `flask_login`
- `@login_required`: Decorator to mark a view as requiring a user to be logged in before they can access the view. You can add this to any view you want. PS this decorator comes from `flask_login` too.

### Layout 

```html
<!-- templates/layout.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title></title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/static/style.css">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
</head>
<body>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <h1>{% if current_user.is_authenticated %} Hello {{current_user.username}} {%endif%}</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        {% if current_user.is_authenticated %}
                <a href="{{url_for('logout')}}" title="logout">Logout</a>
                {% else %}
                <a href="{{url_for('login')}}" title="login">Login</a>
                <a href="{{url_for('register')}}" title="register">register</a>
        {% endif %}
      </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <nav>
              <a href="{{ url_for('index') }}">Index Page with all the posts</a>
        </nav>

      </div>
      <div class="col">
        {% with messages = get_flashed_messages(with_categories=True) %}
            {% if messages %}
                {% for category, message in messages %}
                    <div class={{category}}>{{ message }}</div>
                {% endfor %}
            {% endif %}
        {% endwith %}
      </div>
      <div class="col">
        {% block content %}{% endblock %}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

- `{% with messages ... %}` is how we get our flash messages we've been writing and sending from `app.py`, they are a bunch of tuples that have the category we can use as a classname if we'd like

- we can use `current_user.is_authenticated` to return a `True` or `False` value depending on the current user's authentication status. By the way this is another tool from `flask_login`.

- then just make sure you extend all your pages like the following, to insure the layout is added.  

```html
{% extends "layout.html" %}
{% from 'macros.html' import render_field %}

{% block content %}
<form method="POST" action="" class="form">
    {{ form.hidden_tag() }}
    {% for field in form %}
        {{ render_field(field) }}
    {% endfor %}
    <button type="submit" id="submit">Login!</button>
</form>
{% endblock %}
```


### Post Model
At this point the User has the ability to register, login, and log back out. From this point on we're going to focus our efforts on giving the user a little bit more to do on the site. We're going to associate Users with Posts. Users should be able to create posts of their own, view the posts of others and go to other users' profile pages.

```python
# models.py
# ...

class Post(Model):
    timestamp = DateTimeField(default=datetime.datetime.now)
    user = ForeignKeyField(
        model=User,
        backref='posts'
    )
    content = TextField()

    class Meta:
        database = DATABASE
        order_by = ('-timestamp',)`
        
        
def initialize():
    DATABASE.connect()
    DATABASE.create_tables([User, Post], safe=True)
    DATABASE.close()
```

- Here we are creating a related table to are user model, and assigning a reference on the user table to the posts table, we are then updating our `create_tables` function to include the Post table.  

- Let's update our user model with a method to grab all its own posts 

```python
# models.py
# ...

class User(UserMixin, Model):
    username = CharField(unique=True)
    email = CharField(unique=True)
    password = CharField(max_length=100)
    joined_at = DateTimeField(default=datetime.datetime.now)
    is_admin = BooleanField(default=False)

    class Meta:
        database = DATABASE
        order_by = ('-joined_at',)

    def get_posts(self):
        return Post.select().where(Post.user == self)

    def get_stream(self):
        return Post.select().where(
            (Post.user == self)
        )

# ...
```

- Now lets make the post form 

```python
# form.py
# ...

class PostForm(Form):
    content = TextAreaField("Enter Post here", validators=[DataRequired()])

```

- and our view, made up of the route decorators and the `post()` function definition. We also need to define `g.user` in the `before_request()` function for use in `post()`

```python
@app.before_request
def before_request():
    """Connect to database before each request """
    g.db = models.DATABASE
    g.db.connect()
    g.user = current_user  // ref to current user's id

@app.route('/new_post', methods=('GET', 'POST'))  // 
@login_required // login_required decorator
def post():
    form = forms.PostForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        models.Post.create(user=g.user._get_current_object(),  // g.user just defined above (g.user = current_user)
                           content=form.content.data.strip())  // content=form.content.data.strip()
        flash("Message posted! Thanks!", "success")  // flash success message!!
        return redirect(url_for('index'))  
    return render_template('posts.html', form=form)  // form was submitted  regular POST > just give them login form: form = forms.PostForm()

```

- here the `g.user.__get_current_object()` must be called because in the session it is what is called `lazy loaded` it doens't load the whole object so we have to tell it too.  

- and our html template !! for the posts.html template!!! 

```html
<!-- templates/posts.html -->

{% extends "layout.html" %}
{% from 'macros.html' import render_field %} // cleaner way to code technical debt light using macros.html

{% block content %}
<form method="POST" action="">
    {{ form.hidden_tag() }}
    {% for field in form %}
        {{ render_field(field) }}
    {% endfor %}
    <button type="submit" id="submit">Post!</button>
</form>
{% endblock %}
```

### Show Posts in the stream

```python
# app.py
# ...

@app.route('/')
def index():
    stream = models.Post.select().limit(100)  // ALL Post will show up
    return render_template('stream.html', stream=stream)

# ...
```

- now we'll build the view reference in the last section `strem.html`
```html
<!-- templates/stream.html -->

{% extends "layout.html" %}

{% block content %}
{% for post in stream %}
  <div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
  <!-- strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M') << formatted date time format Tuesday March 19th -->
    <time data-time="{{ post.timestamp }}" class="distime" datetime="{{ post.timestamp.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M') }}">{{ post.timestamp.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M') }}</time>
      <!-- user name is inside of link username=post.user.username  url_for('stream', username=post.user.username)<< build url ß-->
      <h5 class="card-title"><a class="btn btn-primary" href="{{ url_for('stream', username=post.user.username) }}">{{ post.user.username }}</a></h5>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">{{ post.content }}</p>
    </div>
  </div>
{% endfor %}
{% endblock %}
```

- and now lets add our stream views

```python
# app.py
# ...

#  username is part of user name! {{ url_for('stream', username=post.user.username) }}
@app.route('/stream')
@app.route('/stream/<username>') // this is effort to make it vanity url make url look better nice
@login_required // need to dfine the template!
def stream(username=None): 
# conditionally rendering template 
    template = 'stream.html'
    if username and username != current_user.username:  // username is given but not equal to the currently authenticated username!
        user = models.User.select().where(models.User.username == username).get()  // find the right username if not match the currently user
        stream = user.posts.limit(100)
    // otherwise --->>>
    else:
        stream = current_user.get_stream().limit(100) // if username and username login matches > get 
        user = current_user
    if username:
        template = 'user_profile.html'
    return render_template(template, stream=stream, user=user)

# ...
```

- here if the username is the current logged in user they will show the users profile
- otherwise is will just show the stream with everyones posts
- and the `user_profile.html`

```html
<!-- templates/user_profile.html -->

{% extends "stream.html" %}

{% block content %}
<div>
    <div>
        <h1>{{ user.username }}</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div>
            <h5>Posts</h5>
            <p>{{ user.posts.count() }}</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

{{ super() }}  // you get parent info. lay things out so it is easy to understand
{% endblock %}
```

- here we can extend from another template so we don't have to rewrite the code for showing all of the users posts on thier profile page
- calling `{{ super() }}` renders the contents of the parent block

**PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR APP WORKS LOCALLY** 

0. Maybe you want to make a branch to save all your local configuration, git checkout -b local-setup, because I'm not showing you how to configure it to work locally and on heroku at the same time, you can figure that out on your own, there is an idea further down that will allow you to figure out if you are on heroku or not.  


1. Make sure you are in your environment and on the master branch
2. `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt` to make sure everything is installed
4.  add a Procfile `touch Procfile` , this is a file of instructions for heroku on how to run the app
5.  `pip install gunicorn` - [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) is our webserver
6.  `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
7.  add `web: gunicorn app:app` to your Procfile to tell heroku how to run the app

*"web is used by Heroku to start a web server for the application. The app:app specifies the module and application name. In our application we have the app module and our flask application is also called app. If your’s are different you can change them."

8. Deploy - `heroku create kbucket-api-heroku`
9.  In `models.py`, we are going to use the [playhouse](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html) extension to connect to postgres on heroku.  

```python
import os

from playhouse.db_url import connect

DATABASE = connect(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
````

-  python`os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')` is like `process.env.DATABASE_URL` in node, the DATABASE_URL will be defined when ywe add the postgres provision on heroku 

10.  Set an environment variable on heroku to let us know we are in the heroku environment in our code `heroku config:set ON_HEROKU=1` , note you can do the same if you go to heroku and go to the `Config Vars` and just add it you will see `ON_HEROKU` there now with a value of `1` which is basically just a True of False for us.  

11. now lets update our code in app.py 
11a.  Update your cors with your react app address if need be `CORS(dogs_api, origins=["http://localhost:3000", "http://reactaddress.com"], supports_credentials=True)`

11b.  add this code at the bottom of your file above the `if __name__ == '__main__`

```python
import os
## import os at the top of your file 

if 'ON_HEROKU' in os.environ:
    print('hitting ')
    models.initialize()
```

*This is checking to see if we are in the `Heroku` environment, if we are, build our tables. Note you can use this variable anywhere to check if you are on Heroku, you can figure out how to adapt your code to work locally and on heroku.*  

12. Go to heroku and go to your app, and the to the RESOURCES tab and in add-ons add Heroku Postgres
13.  You're done.
14.  From command line 
15.  `git add .`
16.  `git commit -m "prepared for heroku"
17.  `git push heroku master`
18.  `heroku open`
19. `heroku logs` to see errors

Web Development Immersive 51 Homework Repository
==========================================

Office hours with GA's mentors:    
Monday - Thursday 5-7pm, located in Concourse.

Sign up for [1 on 1 with instructional team][1o1].    
Reference [WDI-51 class resources][resources] for each assignment.

How To Use This Repo
--------------------

This is the repository where you'll submit your homework.    
Follow these directions closely to switch over to this repository.

### Setup (do this only once):
1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork to your ```~/code``` folder.
3. Create a directory in the ```sf-wdi-51-assignments``` folder using your real name and github account name. Example: ```sf-wdi-51-homework/nicole-Borgaard```. That will make it easier for us to remember everyone's GitHub username. :)

### How to submit homework assignments:
1. Create a folder for the current week in your personal directory. 
2. Add each assignment in the current week's folder. Example for homework in week 2: `sf-wdi-51-assignments/nicole-Borgaard/week_2/slackBot/hubot.js`
3. `$ cd` to `sf-wdi-51-assignments`. To figure out where you are in terminal, `$ pwd` to find your present working directory.
4. `$ git add .` to stage files you'd like to commit and push to GitHub.
5. `$ git commit -m "adding week 2 slackBot assignment"` to add a descriptive comment about what you're doing. Comments are a requirement of the commit command.
6. `$ git push origin master` to push your local code to your personal remote repository on GitHub.
7. Your homework is now located on your personal repo (`yourUsername/sf-wdi-51-assignments`). Create a pull request to the homework repo (`Borgaard/sf-wdi-51-assignments`) to submit your assignment.


This is how your local directory should be structured:


    |-- wdi/
        |-- sandbox/ 
        |-- exercises/ 
        |-- lessons/ 
        |-- projects/ 
        |-- sf-wdi-51-assignments/ (cloned from Github)
            |-- firstName-githubUsername/
                |-- week_1/
                    |-- bottleApp/
                        |-- bottlesOfBeer.js
                        |-- index.html
                    |-- spontaneousTravelApp/
                        |-- randomAddressGenerator.js
                |-- week_2/
                    |-- hubot/
                        |-- hubot.js
                |-- week_3/
                |-- week_4/
                |-- week_5/

Weekly Homework
---------------

Homework [assigned each week][resources].
If any files are in the pull request outside of your personal folder, we will send it back to you to fix!

**Submit homework by pushing up to your `sf-wdi-51-assignments` fork, then submit a pull request**

Troubleshooting Git:
--------------------

### Submodules != folders
#### Submodule problem:
Submodules are Git's way of treating a project within a project as a separate entity. Explanation from [git-scm's][git-scm] documentation: 
> Submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. This lets you clone another repository into your project and keep your commits separate.

...which is not a feature we want because _instructors are unable to access Submodule folders_, which prevents us from code reviewing your homework and giving you credit for your work.

![submodule](nicole-Borgaard/submodule-example.png)

When commits are made in `sf-wdi-51-assignments` (root directory) with a child `.git` folder nested within, a Submodule is created, so ensure you remove `.git` folders in projects you clone _before_ committing in root. 

#### Submodule Fix    
The student's local personal folder needs to be uncached, which will remove the Submodule.

1. Navigate to root homework directory `sf-wdi-51-assignments` in terminal.
2. Open Finder and use hotkey `cmd` `shift` `.` to view hidden files. You're looking to see that the hidden `.git` shows up in root. If you can see that hidden file, you can see hidden .git folders in child folders.
3. Open child folders to look for hidden .git folders; delete any you find that are not in root. 

PROTIP: use triangle view structure to reveal a folder's contents without entering it: 
![hamburger](nicole-Borgaard/hamburger.png)

4. In terminal from the root `sf-wdi-51-assignments` directory, add and commit your assignment folder's current state. Saving your state at this point is important; **do not skip this step**.
5. `$ git rm --cached -r YOUR_FOLDER_HERE`

Once you git add, commit, and push, your Submodule issue on Github will be resolved. Yay! :tada:

### Help! I can't push!
Read the error.    
What does it say? `$ git status` is your friend.

Here are some common issues:    
* Ensure you have added and committed your code from the root `sf-wdi-51-assignments` directory.    
* Where are you pushing? `git remote --verbose` to see your remote links and their nicknames. Are you pushing to `git push origin master`? Check the spelling.
* Is the error related to a hidden `.git` folder? Follow [steps 1-3](README.md#submodule-fix).

## Overview

###### What is this project?

For the second project, you will use your knowledge of front-end and back-end web development to produce a polished web application that can be used by friends, family, or the wider online community -- and that will benefit your portfolio.

**The objective of this project is to:**

* Work with a group in a shared GitHub repository.
* Plan and implement a larger scale project as part of a development team.
* Integrate topics learned and experience gained in the course so far.
* Showcase your abilities to potential employers, friends, family, and community members.

**You will be working in groups of 4 for this project.**

---

## Planning & Deliverables

###### What will we be turning in?

### Project Planning Deliverables

**You must review the following with your instructional team BEFORE you start to code.**

* **Scope:** What are you planning to build? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?
* **User Stories:** Who is your user? What features will your app have? Set up your project and user stories in <a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a> or in some other organized format.
* **Wireframes:** Sketch out what your core pages will look like and how they will work. Consider making a *paper prototype* to demonstrate and/or test key user interactions.
* **Data Models:** Draw out the models and any associations for your project in an entity relationship diagram (ERD). Keep in mind this project will use a relational, PostgreSQL database
* **Milestones:** Outline the milestones/sprints for your group.
* **Delegating Tasks:** What will each group member work on? Leverage everyone's strengths, and spend the majority of coding time pair programming.

### Completed Project Deliverables

* Link to Heroku hosted project, with all core technical requirements and three flexible technical requirements complete.
* Link to source code on GitHub.
* A `README.md` file with the following:
  * Description: Short paragraph (2-3 sentences) "elevator pitch" describing what your project does
  * Wireframes and user stories
  * Link to Heroku hosted project
  * Technologies (languages, external libraries, APIs)
  * Wish List / Future Development
  * Contributors (with links to their GitHub profiles)

---

## Technical Requirements

###### What technologies will we be using?

### Core Technical Requirements

**Your app should have all of the following:**

* **Flask:** Use Flask as the core framework for Python.
* **PostgreSQL:** Use PostgreSQL for your database in development and production.
* **Data Models** Include at least two data models with associations.
* **Data Validation:** Your application should validate incoming data before entering it into the database.
* **Error Handling:** Forms in your application should also validate data, handle incorrect inputs, and provide user feedback on the client side.
* **Views:** Use **Jinja templates**.
* **Home & About Pages:** Create a landing page (homepage) that clearly explains your app's value proposition and guides the user through the "get started" funnel. Create an about page that includes photos and brief bios of your team members.
* **User Experience:** Ensure a pleasing and logical user experience. Use a framework like Bootstrap, Bulma, or Skeleton to enhance and ease your CSS styling.
* **Responsive Design:** Make sure your app looks great on a phone or tablet.
* **Heroku:** Deploy your app to Heroku. Ensure no app secrets are exposed. *Do not commit secret keys to GitHub!*

### Flexible Technical Requirements

**Your app should have 3 out of the 5 following options:**

* **User Login** Make sure you have authentication *and* authorization.
* **AJAX** Use AJAX to communicate with the server without reloading the page when appropriate.
* **External APIs** Use  a third-party API back-end package to integrate third-party data into your app.
* **JavaScript & jQuery:** Add dynamic client-side behavior with event-driven functionality.
* **User-Friendly URLs:** Make pretty URLs that don't expose database IDs.

---

## Further Exploration

###### What if we want to do more?

If you want to push yourself and learn something new, optionally consider doing any of the following ideas. *Please talk to an instructor beforehand.*

* **Charting:** Visualize your data! Possibilities include D3, Morris.js, Highcharts, Chart.js, and Google Charts.
* **Job Scheduling:** Set up a job-scheduler to queue actions that don't need to run immediately.
* **Emails:** Use `flask-mail` to send emails to your users.
* **Text Messaging:** Use Twilio to send texts to your users (note: not free).
* **Payment:** Use Stripe to allow your users to purchase from or donate to your site.
* **Material Design:** Research the material design paradigm and apply it to ground your app's UI in the physical realm.
* **CSS Animations:** Use jQuery or animate.css to include animations on your site.
* **Accessibility:** Research web accessibility (e.g. for blind users), and apply accessibility principles to your app.
* **Sessions:** Use sessions to store data for site visitors (who aren't necessarily logged in).
* **Search:** Build a form that allows users to search your data, based on attributes. Consider looking into Elasticsearch to speed up queries.
* **Whatever else you can think of!**

1) node, g react 
> npm install create-react-app -g // run react anywhere we want!
resource: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
2) create-react-app to install react app in react-complete-guide
> create-react-app react-complete-guide
> cd react-complete-guide

- in react must put inside one element like div
- react must return html

in App.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>Hi, I'm a React App!</h1>
        <p>This is really working!!!</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;

- note stateful vs stateless
Components are the core building block of React apps. Actually, React
really is just a library for creating components in its core.
A typical React app therefore could be depicted as a component tree -
having one root component ("App") and then an potentially infinite amount
of nested child components.
Each component needs to return/ render some JSX code - it defines
which HTML code React should render to the real DOM in the end.
JSX is NOT HTML but it looks a lot like it. Differences can be seen when
looking closely though (for example className in JSX vs class in "normal
HTML"). JSX is just syntactic sugar for JavaScript, allowing you to write
HTMLish code instead of nested React.createElement(...) calls.
When creating components, you have the choice between two different
ways:
1. Functional components (also referred to as "presentational", "dumb" or
"stateless" components - more about this later in the course) => 
  const cmp = () => { return <div>some JSX</div> } 
  (using ES6 arrow functions as
shown here is recommended but optional)

2. class-based components (also referred to as "containers", "smart" or "stateful"
components) => 
  class Cmp extends Component { render () {
    return <div>some JSX</div> } }

We'll of course dive into the difference throughout this course, you can
already note that you should use 1) as often as possible though. It's the
best-practice.

person.js)
import React from 'react';
// just a function therefore no need for Component
const person = () => {
  // round down for JSX to know it is JS we wrap around {} to compile the dynamic content!!
  return <p>I'm a Person. I am {Math.floor(Math.random() * 30)} years old!!!</p>
}
// make your custome component upper case
//  so react knows it is different
export default person;

app.js)
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
// ./ is relative path cureent dir
//   no need to add .js it is auto
import Person from './Person/Person'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>Hi, I'm a React App!</h1>
        <p>This is really working!!!</p>
        <Person name="Max" age="28" />
        <Person name="Manu" age="28" />
        <Person name="Steven" age="34" />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;

>> Hi, I'm a React App!
This is really working!!!

I'm a Person. I am 4 years old!!!

I'm a Person. I am 21 years old!!!

I'm a Person. I am 20 years old!!!

- return () so you can put mulitiple lines in return
  return (<p>I'm a {props.name}. I am {props.age} years old!!!</p>
  
  )

- children
        <Person name="Manu" age="28" >*** this is props.children!!! My Hobbies: Racing</Person>
            <div>
      <p>I'm a {props.name}. I am {props.age} years old!!!</p>
      <p>{props.children}</p>
    </div>

- for state use when Component is extended
class App extends Component {
  state = {

  }
}

Props & State
Section 3, Lecture 38
props  and state  are CORE concepts of React. Actually, only changes in props  and/ or state  trigger React to re-render your components and potentially update the DOM in the browser (a detailed look at how React checks whether to really touch the real DOM is provided in section 6).

Props

props  allow you to pass data from a parent (wrapping) component to a child (embedded) component.

Example:

AllPosts Component:

const posts = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <Post title="My first Post" />
        </div>
    );
}
Here, title  is the custom property (prop ) set up on the custom Post  component. We basically replicate the default HTML attribute behavior we already know (e.g. <input type="text">  informs the browser about how to handle that input).

Post Component:

const post = (props) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{props.title}</h1>
        </div>
    );
}
The Post  component receives the props  argument. You can of course name this argument whatever you want - it's your function definition, React doesn't care! But React will pass one argument to your component function => An object, which contains all properties you set up on <Post ... /> .

{props.title}  then dynamically outputs the title  property of the props  object - which is available since we set the title  property inside AllPosts  component (see above).



State

Whilst props allow you to pass data down the component tree (and hence trigger an UI update), state is used to change the component, well, state from within. Changes to state also trigger an UI update.

Example:

NewPost Component:

class NewPost extends Component { // state can only be accessed in class-based components!
    state = {
        counter: 1
    };  
 
    render () { // Needs to be implemented in class-based components! Needs to return some JSX!
        return (
            <div>{this.state.counter}</div>
        );
    }
}
Here, the NewPost  component contains state . Only class-based components can define and use state . You can of course pass the state  down to functional components, but these then can't directly edit it.

state  simply is a property of the component class, you have to call it state  though - the name is not optional. You can then access it via this.state  in your class JSX code (which you return in the required render()  method).

Whenever state  changes (taught over the next lectures), the component will re-render and reflect the new state. The difference to props  is, that this happens within one and the same component - you don't receive new data (props ) from outside!

- onclick in jsx onClick react eventhandling using camelCase

React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
For example, the HTML:
<button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button>

is slightly different in React JSX:
<button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button>

- how to add a eventhandler: onClick={this.switchPerson}, switchPerson = () => {
    console.log('I have been clicked!');
  }

 inside my render():
        <button onClick={this.switchPerson}>Switch to new person</button>


  class App extends Component {
  state = {

    ]
  }

  // [ ] add a button to do something
  switchPerson = () => {
    console.log('I have been clicked!');
  }

- how to update the state: we use .setState() and pass the obj we are changing!

class App extends Component {
  state = {
    persons: [
      { name: 'Max', age: 28 },// here number is just number remember earlier <Person name="Max" age="28" /> we passed as string here.
      { name: 'Queen', age: 20 },
      { name: 'Manu', age: 40 }
    ],
    otherState: 'some other value'
  }

  // [ ] add a button to do something
  switchNameHandler = () => {
    // console.log('I have been clicked!');
    // for this to work use es6 syntax () => {}
    // REACT does not allow you to mutate state directly: this.state.persons[0].name = 'Heggy';  instead use the special react Method.. from Component we can use .setState method
    this.setState({
      persons: [
        // react will check for diff of file
        { name: 'Puppy', age: 28 },// here number is just number remember earlier <Person name="Max" age="28" /> we passed as string here.
        { name: 'Queen', age: 20 },
        { name: 'Manu', age: 40 }
      ]
    })

  }


- react way to pass function in app.js parent to child
        <button onClick={this.switchNameHandler}>Switch to new person</button>

        <Person 
          name={this.state.persons[1].name} 
          age={this.state.persons[1].age} 
          click={this.switchNameHandler}>This is props.children!! My Hobbies: Racing</Person>

    child.js)
      return (
    <div>
      <p onClick={props.click}>I'm a {props.name}. I am {props.age} years old!!!</p>
      <p>{props.children}</p>
    </div>

- using bind
  render () {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>Hi, I'm a React App!</h1>
        <p>This is really working!!!</p>
        <button onClick={this.switchNameHandler.bind(this, 'Maxmilian!')}>Switch to new person</button>
        <Person 
          name={this.state.persons[0].name} 
          age={this.state.persons[0].age} />
  {/* passing click property to child */}
        <Person 
          name={this.state.persons[1].name} 
          age={this.state.persons[1].age} 
          click={this.switchNameHandler.bind(this, 'Love!!!')}>This is props.children!! My Hobbies: Racing</Person>
        <Person 
          name={this.state.persons[2].name} 
          age={this.state.persons[2].age} />
      </div>
    );

- this.bind in react

// passing function in onClick function 
        <button onClick={() => this.switchNameHandler('Maxmilian!YAY!!****!!')}>Switch to new person</button>

        <!-- or use .bind(this, argument) -->
        <button onClick={this.switchNameHandler.bind(this, 'Maxmilian!YAY!!****!!')}>Switch to new person</button>

- input to change the value react

  nameChangedHandler = (event) => {
    // let's change the state!
    this.setState({
      persons: [
        { name: 'Max', age: 30 },
        // event has target user click on and input has its value
        { name: event.target.value, age: 10 },
        { name: 'MoreFunny Input', age: 50 }
      ]
    })
  }

  render() {
    return (
              <Person 
          name={this.state.persons[1].name} 
          age={this.state.persons[1].age} 
          click={this.switchNameHandler.bind(this, 'Love!!!')}
          changed={this.nameChangedHandler}>This is props.children!! My Hobbies: Racing</Person>
    )
  }

  import React from 'react';
// just a function therefore no need for Component
//  passing props of parent app.js
const person = (props) => {
  // round down for JSX to know it is JS we wrap around {} to compile the dynamic content!!
  // passing down props from parent component <Person name="Katie" age="34" />
  return (
    <div>
      <p onClick={props.click}>I'm a {props.name}. I am {props.age} years old!!!</p>
      <p>{props.children}</p>
  {/* onChange fire when a value of input changes */}
      <input type="text" onChange={props.changed}/>
    </div>
  
  )
}

- 2 way binding change
1) when change - propogate the change
2) we also want to see the current state right from the start!!
    for this pass value={props.name}
        // see the change from the beginning
          <input type="text" onChange={props.changed} value={props.name}/>
        // Person original value is showing
          <Person 
          name={this.state.persons[1].name} 
          age={this.state.persons[1].age} 
          click={this.switchNameHandler.bind(this, 'Love!!!')}
          changed={this.nameChangedHandler}>This is props.children!! My Hobbies: Racing
          </Person>

- styling components: make it box look 
https://codepen.io/heggy231/pen/EMrqRW

.box {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 60%;
  margin: 13px auto;
  border: 1px solid #eee;
  box-shadow: 1px 5px 7px #ccc;
  padding: 14px;
  text-align: center;
}

- how to scope the styling just for a certain component
render () {
    const style = {
      backgroundColor: 'white',
      font: 'inherit', 
      border: '1px solid blue',
      padding: '8px',
      cursor: 'pointer',
    };

    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>Hi, I'm a React App!</h1>
        <p>This is really working!!!</p>
        <button
          style={style} 
          onClick={() => this.switchNameHandler('Maxmilian!YAY!!****!!')}>Switch to new person</button>

- react basic hw
  - requirements:
[ ] Create TWO new components: UserInput and UserOutput
[ ] UserInput should hold an input element, UserOutput two paragraphs
[ ] Output multiple UserOutput components in the App component (any paragraph texts of your choice)
[ ] Pass a username (of your choice) to UserOutput via props and display it there
[ ] Add state to the App component (=> the username) and pass the username to the UserOutput component
[ ] Add a method to manipulate the state (=> an event-handler method)
[ ] Pass the event-handler method reference to the UserInput component and bind it to the input-change event
[ ] Ensure that the new input entered by the user overwrites the old username passed to UserOutput
[ ] Add two-way-binding to your input (in UserInput) to also display the starting username
[ ] Add styling of your choice to your components/ elements in the components - both with inline styles and stylesheets

# Intro to Redux and State Management
### Objectives

*After this lesson, students will be able to:*

- Understand state in relationship to building Front End Applications
- Describe the benefits of using a global state object vs local state ( we have been learning - local state gets hairy )
- Explain the 3 Principles of Redux (actions/ reducer)
- Explain the roles of actions and the reducer
- Define Redux specific terms (i.e. Reducer, Actions, Store)

### Preparation

*Before this lesson, students should already be able to:*

- Create a simple app in React using `create-react-app`
- Understand how data is passed between components in React
- Be familiar with higher-order functions and object/array destructuring
- Have a deep and painful loathing of passing state and props up and down the component hierarchy

### Going Fast Forever
why? redux: state management has been an issue, front-layer of react, we are working with obj for state
- redux: as we scale up - we managed state local level for wayfair
As developers, our goal when designing software is to **go fast forever**. This means that as professionals, we want to plan and structure our application workflow to allow us to make quick changes and build tons of new and interesting features for months and years without needing to slow down.

- update state: react is for view layer, react releaseed flux architecture - redux is here
React so far has allowed us to build really interactive sites that are easily broken up into small pieces, which allows us to build more efficiently than using a library like jQuery where code can become messy quickly.

The ability to break pieces of our application into small components helps us go fast because we can easily find and change small pieces of our app.  That's why it has so rapidly become the most popular choice to render views.  The downside of this is that React is only concerned with being a **VIEW** layer for your application.  This means that, even though we can manage state and data through React, it's doesn't care about that as much as it does showing and updating the DOM quickly.

### You Do 

With a partner, discuss and write down answers to the following questions.

- What is state?  state: way data flow
- Where does state live in a React application?  state usually lives in parent component, managing complicated state
- How does state get changed? how do you move state around to child elements? thru props, unidirectional flow prop going down 
- How do you pass state from place to place? 


### State in React

Even though React has built in tools to manage and update the state of an application, it is not nearly as strong as the rendering capabilities.  This is by design within Facebook, remember React is a `library` focused on solving a few problems, not a `framework` which is more expansive and is more opinionated.

State in React is only handled within individual components. Whenever we have values that may change we must update our state with the `this.setState()` method. `this.setState()` sets state in local component

This state is private to an individual React component. This is commonly called `Local State`.  The state is defined, called, and transformed only from within the component that owns it.

How do we pass information in a components state to other components?

We can send information down the React component tree through props.  Props allows us to pass values and methods that can reference parts of state and even call methods within the higher level component.  This has worked out great so far, but as your app grows larger it may begin to grow more and more difficult to make changes to your state.  This is why we've lifted our state up to it's very top level in most React apps that we've created. Eventually this becomes an extremely time consuming and risky activity.

One common use case that requires global state like this is having an application with many different views (like when using React Router).

### A Little Bit of History

The React developers designed React in such a way as to remain unopinionated about complex React state management. They introduced the [Flux application architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) to fill that void. (Flux architecture helps us get to global stored obj) Flux allows developers to extract the local state of components into something called a **store** (basically a giant object with all of your data).  To manage state in 1 spot > flux hold state separately

Flux is only an architecture. A collection of ideas about HOW you should build an app.  After it was introduced, tons of tools were created to implement the Flux pattern, but one has emerged as the favorite choice, Redux.  Flux is not fully developed architecture,

### Enter Redux (is based on Flux)

Redux is a library that expands on the ideas of the Flux pattern and combines it with the ideas that power the `reduce` higher order function.  I highly recommend checking out the talk where the creator Dan Abramov introduced Redux [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs)

Through using Redux, we will be able to take all of the state out of our individual components, and instead house them inside of a **store**.

### But you don't have to take my word for it!

Read [this Medium post](https://medium.com/dailyjs/when-do-i-know-im-ready-for-redux-f34da253c85f) written by a developer who built a React app for the Australian Broadcast Corporation.  It's a great real world example of how React becomes more and more difficult to handle as projects become more difficult.

really nice post read this!

- After working on the app for a month, what are some of the pain points the team found by just using React by itself?
- In your own words, describe how Redux handles data differently than React on its own.
- According to the articles, what benefits did his team gain by using a State Management Library like Redux?

## Understanding Redux

The state problems introduced when scaling up React Applications is not unique to this single library.  This problem occurs in Angular 1 & 2, Backbone, Ember and lots of other front-end frameworks.  As data needs to be moved around more often, it is sometimes necessary for that data to all live in another place.  One of the great things about Redux is that is library and framework agnostic, meaning that it can be used in all of these other libraries as well!

When people first get started with Redux, the biggest difficulties with its learning curve is understanding the terminology and philosophy behind the library.  This difficulty is compounded when you try to learn Redux terminology at the same time as learning the other tools to implement Redux.  For now, we are focusing on the terms related to the Redux library and design pattern.

### Terminology

Just like when we learned about MVC, there are several new terms to learn when we begin to utilize Redux.  Though we will see more terms when we connect it to React, Redux itself only has 4 major concepts to understand.

#### Store (1st obj of Redux)

The store is the `Single Source of Truth` that information in a program flows through. The store encapsulates not only the data in the program, but also controls the flow of program data, storing each change in a separate state. Redux even gives us the ability to time travel through our application's history of application states. It ends up looking like a really large JavaScript object.

stores each change in sseparate state - it has time stamp pointA, PointB
All the principles of Redux are embodied in the store. The store holds an application's states (including current and previous states), actions which specify different changes to make on some part of the application state (changes that are going to ), and the reducer (it also references reducers), which specifies which actions update the state object.

Since state is being represented as an immutable data-structure, we cannot directly modify it. Changing state in the program requires dispatching an action that modifies a copy of the state.

#### Action (simplest to understand: type, value)

The action is the simplest of new terms. Actions are simply a JavaScript object that describes what change is being made and contains any data relative to the change. Bare min give the type

```js
{
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  todo: 'Learn Redux'
}
```

The only requirement of these actions is that it must be an object with a `type` that is a string.  Any additional key/value pairs are completely optional.

These actions feed new data into our store, and are typically created inside of an action creator.

#### Action Creator: function return an Action

Action Creators are just functions that return an Action.

```js
const addTodo = (todo) => { // type of addTodo
  return { // return obj, type, value todo
    type: 'ADD_TODO',  
    todo: todo
  }
}

addTodo('Learn Redux')
```

### Reducer - (3rd part of redux to understand)

When an action gets dispatched it is sent to the Reducer.  The Reducer is a `pure` function that describes how the action will update the store (aka state object)

copy of state, 
The reducer will always take the **previous state** and the **action** that was dispatched and will always return a brand new state. The body of the function is normally a switch statement that looks at the `type` property in the action.  Each `case` in the switch statement will be an action `type` that the reducer is listening for.  If there is a match, the reducer will return a brand new object or array for the state object.

```js
const exampleReducer = (state, action) => {  // Reducer always takes 2 agmts 1)prev version state, 2)action user is trying to do
  switch(action.type){ // case was add todo
    case: 'EXAMPLE_ACTION'
      //Do some stuff and return a new state
      return newState  // return new copy of state obj

    // Make sure to always have a default that returns state
    default:
      return state;  // consuming prev version of state - this has time line state management
  }
}
```
Based on user's update on site, what goes on in the application with user updates timeline

### 3 Principles of Redux

#### 1. Single Source of Truth (key par: state is no longer local, it is global, share same state all the time, FLUX related ) -For Redux will handle state changes

**The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.**

This makes it easy to create universal apps, as the state from your server can be serialized and hydrated into the client with no extra coding effort. A single state tree also makes it easier to debug or inspect an application; it also enables you to persist your app's state in development, for a faster development cycle. Some functionality which has been traditionally difficult to implement - Undo/Redo, for example - can suddenly become trivial to implement, if all of your state is stored in a single tree.

#### 2. State is Read-Only (state is read-only- emit an action: obj that describing what user did, this is only way to change state, actions to emit the call, modify > return new version)

**The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.**

This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state. Instead, they express an intent to transform the state. Because all changes are centralized and happen one by one in a strict order, there are no subtle race conditions to watch out for. As actions are just plain objects, they can be logged, serialized, stored, and later replayed for debugging or testing purposes.  
- extract out those state chage functions: action itself funnel thru reducer to update the store
- components are reading the state

#### 3. Changes are Made with Pure Functions (changes we make require Pure function, function with no side effects, they make calcuations for variables, pure functions: do not mutating the previous state, one reducer, one place, reducers are functions)

**To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.**

Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the next state. Remember to return new state objects, instead of mutating the previous state. You can start with a single reducer, and as your app grows, split it off into smaller reducers that manage specific parts of the state tree. Because reducers are just functions, you can control the order in which they are called, pass additional data, or even make reusable reducers (action agnotic, repeatable) for common tasks such as pagination (many movies, loading only 20 more limit).

### Reducer Deep Dive  (state, action) => newState

> The Redux reducer API is `(state, action) => newState`, but how you create those reducers is up to you. -Dan Abramov

Learning how to properly manipulate the reducer is by far the most difficult part of programming with Redux. Let's take a little bit of a deeper look at it and see if we can demystify the hard parts.

It's important to remember that the reducer's job is not to transform your state, but instead to **completely** replace the old state with a brand new state object.  This is achieved through combining two concepts built into JavaScript: **switch statements** and **pure functions**.

#### Switch Statements

It's possible that you have seen switch statements previously.  Switch statements are an additional way to handle conditionals in JavaScript. They are useful for scenarios where the alternative is a lot of `if-else` statements.

```js
switch(condition){  // pass in what action we are doing for toggling find case t/f activate
  case 'scenario 1':
    return 'Scenario one Selected'
  case 'scenario 2':
    return 'Scenario two selected'
  default:
    return 'Default Value Selected'
}
```

```js
if (condition === 'scenario 1'){
    return 'Scenario one Selected'
} else if (condition === 'scenario 2'){
    return 'Scenario two selected'
} else {
  return 'Default Value Selected' // default value why? default state value, we want default state needs to be  if default value will create the state
}
```

#### Pure Functions

**Given the same arguments, it should calculate the next state and return it. No surprises. No side effects. No API calls. No mutations. Just a calculation.**

Redux relies on pure functions in order to trigger the update life cycle for a React component.  A pure function is simply a function where given the same inputs it will always output the same value.  Additionally, pure functions will always output a brand new value.  Prior to ES6/ES7, it was very difficult to build pure functions, but this style of programming has exploded in popularity in recent years.

Let's take a look at some different ways we can output a brand new value.

- `[...previousArray]`  This is an example of spreading an array
- `{...previousObject}` This is a spread object
- `map, filter, reduce` are all examples of built in methods that clone an array.

### You Do:

Use pure functions to solve the following problems:

1. Use a pure function to add a `todo` to this existing array of todo objects:

```js
const todos = [
  {
    id: 1,
    task: 'Learn React',
    completed: true
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    task: 'Learn Redux',
    completed: false
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    task: 'Watch Black Mirror',
    completed: true
  }
]

const newTodo = {
  id: 4,
  task: 'Buy a Tesla',
  completed: false
}

function addTodo(todos, newTodo){
  // Your code here
}

console.log(addTodo(todos, newTodo))
```

2. Create a pure function called `editUserObject` that will take 2 objects, one that represents a user and another that represents changes to that user object.  Make sure that the object you return is a brand new object.

```js
const user = {
  name: 'Steve Jobs',
  company: 'Apple',
  email: 'steve@mac.me'
}

const userChanges = {
  email: 'steve@geocities.com'
}

function editUserObject(currentUser, edits){
  // Your code here
}

console.log(editUserObject(user, userChanges))
```

3. Return an array of objects that removes all fruits.

```js
const fruitsAndVeggies = ['Apple', 'Squash', 'Orange', 'Pear', 'Lime']

function removeFruit(originalArray){
  // Your code here
}

console.log(removeFruit(fruitsAndVeggies))
```

### Objectives

*After this lesson, students will be able to:*

- Use the `react-redux` library to connect a Redux store to a React Application
- Demonstrate the directory structure of a React/Redux app
- Wrap `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` to React components.
- Complete common user interactions using React/Redux

### Preparation

*Before this lesson, students should already be able to:*

- Explain the following Redux terms: store, action, reducer
- Build a React application using `create-react-app`

## Redux Reviewed

So far, we have talked about Redux as an abstract pattern that allows us to extract our data into something called a store and change that store through dispatching actions.

## Combining React and Redux

- directly connect to store - 
The code behind the Redux library is surprisingly small. The core logic that sets up the store and the ability to dispatch actions is only around 200 lines of code.  That's because the Redux library is only meant to set up and manage the store and connect it to the reducer.  The Redux library is actually library agnostic.  While it is most common in React, you can use Redux with Angular, Vue, hyperapp, choo, and all sorts of different libraries (or no libraries at all!)

## Do I Need Redux?

Before we start building something with Redux, it's important to evaluate whether or not we will benefit from introducing another tool.  This is a habit that will become more and more important to you grow as a developer. There are hundreds of thousands of libraries available on NPM, some will help you get work done more efficiently, others will not.  Being a professional means knowing the right tools for the job.

Redux is not a tool you want to use in every scenario.  Redux requires you to make changes to multiple files for every simple change. Do you want to edit 3-4 files just to handle an `onClick` method?  Weigh the pros vs the cons with implementing a tool like Redux.

If you expect to build an app with multiple routes that share state in many places, you may want to consider Redux.  If your application is just going to be a few components all on one page, you may not need to introduce this additional complexity.

### Building a React/Redux Application

The biggest drawback to React/Redux other than learning the new terminology is that it adds a few extra steps to the development process.  In the long run, this can be beneficial since it helps easily scale an application by removing the constraints of unidirectional data flow.  We hav to edit 4-5 updating state break the functionality to follow the process.  state is in mult.

> "Earlier frameworks made building Todo apps simple but real apps hard. But React/Redux make building Todo apps hard but real productions apps simple."

Today we are going to build a basic to-do application, but focus in on the boilerplate to set-up a Redux app and introduce some of the terminology we will be using when utilizing the `react-redux` library.

### We Do: Clone the starter code and download the Redux Dev Tools

For the sake of time, we are going to start out with some of our code already completed.  [Redux Todo List](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-WDI/redux-todo-list) is an app with a few components already set up for you.  Clone this repo and start to review the code we have in here currently. Is there anything that doesn't look familiar to you?

Additionally, go ahead and download the [Redux Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en).  We are going to be using this tool often to track the state changes in our app.

### You Do

This current application has some state in the `Todos.js` and some state in `TodoForm.js`, but they are currently not functioning because they have to share state.

Think about how would you solve this problem using only React? Feel free to checkout into another branch and try to refactor the code to add todos from the input field.

### Do we need Redux here?

Again, this is always an important question to ask when you are looking to add more libraries and tools to an application.  In the case of this application, if we were ONLY building a simple todo app like we're doing today, I would personally choose not to use Redux.  However, if we continued to work on the application and expected it to become more complex in both features and scope, then Redux would be a valuable too.  In any case, this exercise will allow us to become more familiar with how to set up Redux in a React application and how to implement new features.

### Let's Get Started

With the current state of our app, it is impossible for the `Todos` and `TodoForm` without hoisting the state of each component up to the `App` level or restructuring the structure of the React component tree.  Instead, we can connect these components to an outside state management library like Redux which will handle updating state for us.


#### Codealong: Adding the Redux boilerplate

1. **Install Dependencies** We'll start by installing the two libraries necessary to introduce Redux into our app.

```bash
npm i redux react-redux
```

2. **Add New Files and Directories**: In order to handle the addition of *stores*, *reducers*, and *action creators*, we need to create a few new files and directories. Add the following folders and directories to the project.
  - in `src`, add 2 directories called `actions` and `reducers`
  - Within `reducers`, add a file called `index.js`
  - Within `actions`, add a file called `todoActions.js`
  - In the `src` add a file called `configureStore.js`

3. **Add the Provider Component**:  Now that we have our files and directories sorted, let's start integrating `redux` and `react-redux` into our application.  The starting point for this integration is the `Provider` component that is built into `react-redux`.  This component gets wrapped around your entire application and takes a single prop called `store`.  This does most of the work linking React and Redux together. We'll create this store in just a moment. Add the `Provider` in the `index.js` file. Let's also import our `configureStore` file which will handle the set up of our Redux store. (We'll do this in the next step)

step by step
<!-- https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-wdi-51/react-and-redux/blob/master/README.md -->
```js
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import App from './components/App'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker'
import configureStore from './configureStore'

const store = configureStore();

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}> // this similiar to React-DOM
    <App />
  </Provider>
  , document.getElementById('root'))

registerServiceWorker()

```

4. **Set Up The Redux Store**: The function we created earlier called `configureStore` is going to hold the logic that connects our store to our reducers and any additional middleware (more on that tomorrow)

For now, the only middleware we want to add is the Redux Devtools Extension.  If you take a look at the docs, it will show you how to quickly and easily add the dev tools to a Redux store.

Additionally, we will import the reducers we will make soon.  Notice here that our import path is only `./reducers` instead of `./reducers/index`.  This is just a small shortcut that you can take with JavaScript.  If no file name is given, JavaScript will just use the file within the directory called `index`

```js
// ./src/configureStore.js

import { createStore } from 'redux'
import reducer from './reducers'

// middleware
function configureStore() { 
  const store = createStore(
    reducer,
    window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()
  )
  return store
}

export default configureStore

```

5. **Building The Index Reducer**: Considering that our application may scale up to be really really large, it's easy to imagine that we will eventually have an **enormous** state object and a reducer with dozens or even hundreds of cases for updating our state.  This does not sound very pleasant, so Redux provides a great method called `combineReducers` that will allow us to write a lot of smaller, more specific reducers that get combined for you when the page loads.  Our `./reducers/index.js` file will hold that method and connect all the various reducers we will build over the lifespan or our application.  For now, we can just add create a file called `todosReducer.js` and bring it into our index.

```js
// ./src/reducers/index.js

import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
import todos from './todoReducer'

// Combine all our reducers together
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  todos
})

export default rootReducer

```

6. **Creating The Todo Reducer**: This is the file that will actually contain the reducers that we saw earlier in class.  Here we will set our default argument to the list of todos in the Todos component, and only provide the default action for our switch statement for now.

```js
// ./src/reducers/todoReducer.js

const defaultState = [
  {
    id: 0,
    task: 'Test this Todo Page',
    completed: false
  },
  {
    id: 1,
    task: 'Learn Redux',
    completed: false
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    task: 'Learn React',
    completed: true
  }
]

function todos (state = defaultState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    default:
      return state
  }
}

export default todos

```

**CHECKPOINT** We have now completed the boiler plate for our Redux app. It was a lot of set up, but now we can leverage the full power of Redux!!

From here we can open up the Redux Dev tools and see our state object.  Our next step is to start building our actions to update the store and connecting that to Redux.

7. **Connect Redux Todos to React App**: Let's use our Redux store to replace the local state within `Todos` with the global state that we've placed within our todo reducer. In order to do this, we will need to bring in another method from the `react-redux` library called `connect`.  `connect` is a method that you wrap around your entire component as well as two additional functions that dictate what parts of your Redux state and actions you want to add to the component.  These functions are commonly known as `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps`.  For now, we will just connect our Redux state to the component.

```js
// ./src/components/Todos.js

import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { connect } from 'react-redux'

class Todos extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <ul>
          {this.props.todos.map(todo => (
            <li key={todo.id}>{todo.task}: {todo.completed.toString()}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return {
    todos: state.todos
  }
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Todos)  // mapStateToProps: it takes the state obj make it to property of Todos

```

8. **Create an Add Todo Action**: So far we are only have a static global state, which is impossible to update.  In order to update it, we will need to do a few things.  Our first step for adding updates is to build an action creator that will dispatch a new todo. Remember that actions are require a `type` in order for reducers to pick up any pending changes.

Notice you will need to install a new library called uuid. This will generate a **U**niversally **Unique** **ID** for each new todo list item in our app.

```js
// ./actions/todoActions
// rememeber to install > install npm i uuid
import uuid from 'uuid'

export function addTodo (task) {
  return {
    type: 'ADD_TODO',
    todo: {
      id: uuid(),
      task: task,
      completed: false
    }
  }
}

```
> install npm i uuid

9. **Add A Case for the Action in the TodoReducer**: The next step is to add a case for 'ADD_TODO' in the todosReducer.  Within the case we need to make sure we return a new state that includes the newest todo coming from our action.

```js
// ./src/reducers/todoReducer.js

...
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return [ ...state, action.todo ]
...

```

10. **Connect Action to TodoForm**: Finally, let's add our new action to the `TodoForm` component.  Here, we will be using the `connect` method to apply `mapDispatchToProps`.

```js
// ./src/components/TodoForm.js

import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { connect } from 'react-redux'
import { addTodo } from '../actions/todoActions'

class TodoForm extends Component {
  state = {
    newTodo: ''
  }

  handleChange = (event) => {
    console.log(event.target.value)
    this.setState({ newTodo: event.target.value })
  }

  handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    this.props.addTodo(this.state.newTodo)
    this.setState({ newTodo: '' })
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <input
          onChange={this.handleChange}
          value={this.state.newTodo}
        />
        <button>Add Todo</button>
      </form>
    )
  }

}

export default connect(null, { addTodo })(TodoForm)

```

**HOLD UP** Why are we using state here?! We are choosing to use local state for this form because it is NEVER going to be referred to outside of this component.  Because of this, it is safe for us to write this in your local state, which is much quicker to accomplish.  This is a really important lesson to learn in Redux.  Keep your user stories in mind when considering using local state.  Redux is not an all or nothing decision.

**HOORAY** We did it! I know it was a lot of steps, but as the application becomes more and more complex, this pattern will allow you to keep your code well organized, easily testable, and independent.

Now we can easily add more functionality to our application through utilizing actions and the reducer.  Let's try to add the ability to click a todo to mark it complete or incomplete.  Even though this simple interaction now requires editing 3 files, we gain the benefit of easily testable code and prevent our individual components from becoming really complicated.  Let's start by building the action we want to dispatch.

```js
// ./src/actions/todoActions.js

...
export function toggleTodo (id) {
  return {
    type: 'TOGGLE_TODO',
    id
  }
}

```

Next up, let's attach the action to the onClick for a ToDo

```js
// ./src/components/Todos.js

import { toggleTodo } from '../actions/todoActions'

...

  <li
    key={todo.id}
    onClick={() => this.props.toggleTodo(todo.id)} //Why do we wrap this in an arrow function?
  >
    {todo.task}: {todo.completed.toString()}
  </li>

...

export default connect(mapStateToProps, { toggleTodo })(Todos)

```

Finally, we add a case to our reducer to handle the action being dispatched. In this scenario, we need to clone our state object, then map through the array and change the todo that has the same id as what is given via the action.

```js
// ./src/reducers/todoReducer.js

...
  case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
    const newState = state.map(todo => {
      if (todo.id === action.id) {
        todo.completed = !todo.completed
      }
      return todo
    })
    return newState
...

```

Voila! That wasn't too bad, right? This process becomes especially easy as you learn more keyboard shortcuts to hop between files.

## Lab - Build Features/Teachback

Now it's time to build out some Redux features on your own! Split into your standup groups and mob program to build out several new features for our todo app.  If you get finished before the time is up, let your instructor know and he/she will give you more features.  At the end of 45 minutes, you will share with the class how you built your feature.

**Features**
- Edit a Todo Item by clicking a button and then filling out a form.
- Delete a Todo Item by clicking a delete button
- Add an input field that filters Todos that don't match the string in the input.
- Add 3 buttons `Show All`, `Show Completed`, and `Show Current` and add onClick attributes to each which will narrow the todos shown in the DOM.
- Add a button called `Clear Completed` that will deleted all completed todos

## Time Pending
  
### Middleware in Redux - help 

Just like Express, Redux has the ability to leverage middleware to enhance the developer experience and clean up your code.  The most common piece of middleware is one we've already seen, the Redux Dev Tools.  There are plenty of other pieces of middleware out there, like `redux-logger` and `thunk`.  You can easily integrate this middleware through the `configureStore` file.  Beware not to go overboard here, else you risk some performance hits.

#### Redux Thunk

You may have seen the term above and made a double take.  What is a `thunk`?!  This really poorly named library simply allows you to make async calls in an action creator, which is impossible to do by default.  A thunk simply returns a new function that dispatches multiple other actions.  Dealing with pinging

```js
function fetchProductsPending () {
  return {
    type: 'FETCH_PRODUCTS_PENDING'
  }
}

function fetchProductsSuccess (products) {
  return {
    type: 'FETCH_PRODUCTS_SUCCESS',
    products
  }
}

function fetchProductsFailure(err) {
  return {
    type: 'FETCH_PRODUCTS_FAILURE',
    err
  }
}

//This is a redux-thunk. Notice it dispatches multiple other actions depending on whether or not the promise resolves or is rejected. if it is not executing in right order, this is how you handle it. 
export function fetchProducts () {
  return async dispatch => {
    dispatch(fetchProductsPending())
    try {
      const { data } = await axios.get('./api/products')
      return dispatch(fetchProductsSuccess(data))
    } catch (err){
      dispatch(fetchProductsFailure(err))
    }
  }
}
```

#### Boilerplate

Getting Redux set up by hand is a time consuming task and is close to the same every single time.  For that reason, there are several boilerplates available online.  [Here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/SF-WDI/redux-boilerplate) is one that gets you started with the basics without adding a bunch of features that you don't need right off the bat.

READ BEFORE YOU START!
Section 1, Lecture 2

PLEASE READ THIS LECTURE CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU START THE ACTUAL COURSE. THANK YOU!


How to ask for help?
I hope you're excited after seeing the final Omnifood project! Now, as you go through the course, you might have a question about a specific topic, or get stuck in a coding lecture and need help.

Whenever that happens, you can get help in the official course Q&A section. My Teaching Assistant Aleksander or I myself will be there answering your questions as fast as possible!

To use the official course Q&A, please follow the following steps:

Start by spending some time trying to solve the problem on your own. This is very important for your learning process!
To find errors, compare your code with the downloadable code for each section. Use a diffchecker for that.
Check if your question has already been asked before in the relevant lecture.
If you can’t solve the problem, you will get help in the Q&A!
If you have a small piece of code, please post it to the Q&A along with the question. For longer code, please post it to a new codepen (http://codepen.io/pen/), hit save, copy your link and share it in the Q&A.
Explain your problem very specifically: that makes answering easier.
We will try to help you as soon as possible, or also a fellow student might help you. Many students actually find that helping others helps themselves getting better and better at coding.

* **Don’t get too caught up in awesome features.** Simple is always better, and you can build something impressive that does one thing well.
* **Design first.** Planning with user stories and wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind. You'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short-term problems.
* **Read the docs** for whatever technologies / frameworks / APIs you use.
* **Write DRY code** and **build RESTful APIs**.
* **Be consistent with your code style.**
* **Commit early, and commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something, because you can always go back in time to a previous version. **Work on feature branches to minimize risk.**
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories say what a user needs from your app, not what development tasks you have to tackle.
* **Write well-formatted and readable code.** Are you indenting consistently? Can you find the start and end of every `<div>`, curly brace, etc.?
* **Comment your code.** Will another developer understand what's going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious to you, explaining the what and why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** It helps to think through the logic before coding the functionality.

## Overview

###### What is this project?

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most advanced project to date, and it'll hopefully be the shining beacon of bragging rights for your portfolio as you make your way out into the world of web development.

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea**, choosing a framework and tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Use everything you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone**.

Make sure it's **something you can accomplish in the limited time we have**, and make sure it's **something that will be visually impressive**.

**You may work on this project individually or in pairs.** See the [project planning deliverables](#project-planning-deliverables) section below for extra planning requirements for pairs.

---

## Big Goals

###### What should I focus on?

* **Discover or invent an idea**, preferably one with some group of users that would jump at the chance to really use your product.
* **Design a product *you* want to build**, and choose _appropriate technologies_ to build it.
* **Pitch your idea** to your classmates and instructors, and incorporate their feedback.
* **Make productive use of your time**, and balance responsibilities to make a complete, impressive-looking project.
* **Focus on writing solid, real-world code** that is well-documented and DRY.

---

## Technical Requirements

###### What technologies will I be using?

**Your app must meet the following technical requirements:**

* **Use a database**, whether it's one we've covered in class or one you want to learn.
* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own back-end and your own front-end.
* **Create a complete product**, which most likely means multiple related resources and CRUD functionality for each.
* **Create a focused product**. Know which features are essential to build for your MVP and which to set aside for later.
* **Craft thoughtful user stories** that are significant enough to help you ensure a pleasing and logical user experience.
* **Handle errors gracefully**, and provide useful feedback to users when errors or validation failures do occur.
* **Make a product that's impressive-looking**; up your design and style game to kick your portfolio up a notch.
* **Deploy your application online** so it's publicly accessible.

---

## Further Exploration

###### What if I want to do more?

* **Incorporate an external API** to add data and functionality to your application.
* **Use a data visualization library** to help users understand your core data.
* **Implement third-party log in** to allow users to access data from other services.
* **Build something you can really launch**, and recruit an actual user-base.
* **Test** critical components of your code to ensure that it works.

---

## Planning & Deliverables

###### What will I be turning in?

### Project Planning Deliverables

**You should review the following with your instructional team BEFORE you start to code.**

* **Scope:** What are you planning to build? What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?
* **User Stories:** Who is your user? What features will your app have? Set up your project and user stories in <a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a>.
* **Wireframes:** Sketch out what your core pages will look like and how they will work. Consider making a *paper prototype* to demonstrate and/or test key user interactions.
* **Data Models:** Draw out the models and any associations for your project in an entity relationship diagram (ERD).
* **Milestones:** Divide your work into parts - the most essential features for your MVP, features that are important but not essential, and features that can be saved for a later iteration. Create 3-5 major milestones with dates outlining when you expect essential features will be done.
* **Feasibility Study:** If you're using an external API or scraping a website, make sure you can get that data. If you're using a new language, framework, or tool, go through its getting started tutorial. We *will* ask to see your results.

### Completed Project Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application**, hosted somewhere on the internet.
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with frequent commits dating back to the beginning of the project.
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo.
* **A `README.md` file** with:
  * A **link to your hosted working app**.
  * A paragraph-long **description** (elevator pitch) of your project.
  * A list of the **technologies used**.
  * A list of **installation steps** for the app itself and any dependencies - how would another developer run your site locally?
  * Link to your **user stories** - who are your users, what do they want, and why?
  * Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application.
  * Link to your **entity relationship diagrams** – plan out your data relationships before coding.
  * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **future features**.

# Intro to Sass

<img src='https://sass-lang.com/assets/img/logos/logo-b6e1ef6e.svg' width='300px'>

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
*After this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Have a clear understanding of what Sass is and the benefits of writing in Sass.
- Will be able to develop a clean css workflow in Sass. You can use logic inside of CSS


### STUDENT PRE-WORK
*Before this lesson, you should already be able to:*

- Can write and understand clear CSS.
- Understand how variables and nesting works.  
- Can use cmd line to initialize and compile projects.

***

## Overview

#### What is Sass? 

Sass is an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic language. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized, and get small stylesheets up and running quickly, particularly with the help of the Compass style library.

[Compass Library](http://compass-style.org/)

As you can see Sass can add alot of functionality to css to improve front end development life.

##### So let's get Sassy! 
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/BhhvMflNABkoE/giphy.gif" width="300px">

## Common Myths - incorrect belief

There are alot of common misconceptions about Sass but let us tackle the biggest ones.

- Sass will change the way I write css entirely
- Sass is messy code.
- Sass will make my site less compatible across browsers.

### The Truth

Sass is no different then standard css in 90% of its syntax. In fact Sass has devoted to be compatible with ALL versions of css. 

Here is standard css.- standard CSS

``` css 
    article{ font-family: helvetica; }
    article h1{ color: #333377;}
    article p{ color: #333377;}
    article p:hover{ color: #cc3333;}

```
And here is Sass.
```scss 
    $mainColor: #333377;  // you can store in variable in SASS
    
    article{  // with SASS you can nest!! if you can nest in HTML, you can nest in CSS
        font-family: helvetica;
        h1{ color: $mainColor;}
        p{ color: $mainColor;
        &:hover{ color: #cc3333;}
        }  
    }
    
```
As you can see Sass reads the same as standard css but instead of calling each parent container you can nest the children elements inside the css! So much cleaner to read alrady. 

Did you also notice the amazing $ symbol? We were able to save that color as a variable to call in our properties. This means we can from one location update multiple css elements! This is only a few of the ways that Sass can help you step up your css game.

***

## How does Sass work?

Sass takes your written Scss file and compiles it into css to be used in your site. There are a couple ways to do this, but we will be showing you the simplest way in terminal. 

### Installation and Use

Sass can be installed globally via homebrew! 


#### In terminal run
```bash
$ brew install sass/sass/sass
```
-- // note: Brew check run thru doctor to see if you need a update.  
This will allow us to run the Sass commands to compile the Sass into regular Css. You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and where to output CSS to. For example, running 

 ```bash 
 $ sass input.scss output.css // one time update for compile
 ``` 
 
 inside your project folder will take a single Sass file, input.scss, and compile that file to output.css.

You can also watch individual files or directories with the --watch flag. The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for changes, and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass. If you wanted to watch (instead of manually build) your input.scss file, you'd just add the watch flag to your command, like so:

```bash
$ sass --watch input.scss output.css  // kind of like nodemon, everytime you save it will update and complie each time auto
```
If you are looking to do all of your Sass and css files together you can set the input and output as you directories. 
```
$ sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets  // this is folder structure, --watch
```
Once Sass is running you will see this.
inside of react sass folder on src level
$ sass --watch sass:src

<img src='assets/watchingSass.png' alt='output'/>

***

- DONT put Sass inside of public folder, it is just for us to use.
## The Benefits of Being Sassy

Next we are going to break down the advantages that Sass brings to the table. 

### Variables - one of biggest thing about Sass! single variable to update the color of your thru out

Currently in css the only way to style several elements together is to either use an existing css library or manually style every element one at a time. Which is fine when you are working on a small project, but imagine the complications that arise when you have a large scale project and you have to update several places. 

To wrap our heads around this we will be looking at the Bulma Css file and how they went about using variables to streamline their css file. 

[Bulma Css](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bulma/0.7.1/css/bulma.css)

Now let's look how they established variables to quickly create themes with the same css base.

[Bulma Sass](https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/variables/)

#### Creating variables

With the power of variables you can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass uses the $ symbol to make something a variable. Here's an example:

```scss

$primary-font: Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #777;

body{
    font: $primary-font;
    color: $primary-color;
}

```

### Practice 

Clone down this repo and let's play with the starter-code. 

Inside you will find a beautiful blanket html along with a main.scss and main.css . For this practice we will be dealing with the main.scss . 

*Hint (Make sure you run the Sass command so your Sass will auto compile into your css)*

Right now as we look at our scss file we see some repeating colors.

One example.
```scss

header{
    width: 100vw;
    display: block;
    text-align: center;
    color: white;
    background-color: aquamarine;
    margin-top: 0;
    padding: 1em; 
}

footer {
    width: 100vw;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 1em;
    text-align: center;
    background-color: aquamarine;
}

```

If we wanted to change the colors of our site we would have to go to every instance and change it. Let's create a variable and store that color. 

```scss

$primary-color: aquamarine;  // this is the variable

header{
    width: 100vw;
    display: block;
    text-align: center;
    color: white;
    background-color: $primary-color;
    margin-top: 0;
    padding: 1em; 
}

footer {
    width: 100vw;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 1em;
    text-align: center;
    background-color: $primary-color;
}

```

Now when we change the variable it will reflect across ALL instances! Saving time and making our develoment more efficiant. 
Go throughout all the css and combine as many similar attributes into variables as you can. Then adjust the variables to reflect the styles of your choice. 

So easy its like magic! 

<img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/wAjfQ9MLUfFjq/giphy.gif' alt='amazed gif' width='250px'>

### Additional resource 

Check out this fun scss project and adjust the $color1 and $color2 to really see the power of assigning variables.

[Submarine Codepen](https://codepen.io/ajerez/pen/EaEEOW)

***

### Nesting

Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML. 

**WARNING**

Be aware that overly nested rules will result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain and is generally considered bad practice.

That being said lets look at how our current scss looks in the start code. 

```scss
article {
    background-color: $article-color;
    width: 47vw;
}
article img{ // nesting 
    width: 100%;
}
article h2{
    background-color: black;
    color: $header-font;
    text-align: center;
    margin-bottom: 0;
    padding: .3em;
}
article p {
    padding: .5em;
}

```
Nesting more than 2 levels deep is not good: 
ex) bad example  CSS goes backwards: 
  artice < section < p < a  // css start from most inner part where you usu. have many a tags, p tags then article 

Yikes! So much repeating code! Let's use Sass nesting to dry it up. 

```scss
article {
    background-color: $article-color;
    width: 47vw;
    img{
    width: 100%;
    }
    h2{
    background-color: black;
    color: $header-font;
    text-align: center;
    margin-bottom: 0;
    padding: .3em;
    }
    p {
    padding: .5em;
    }
}
```

With this new structure it is very clear to see the inheritance of css properties. 
Go through the starter code and nest all children css properties with their parents. 

**BUT WAIT!** How does this compile in css? 


```css
article {
    background-color: $article-color;
    width: 47vw;
}
article img{
    width: 100%;
}
article h2{
    background-color: black;
    color: $header-font;
    text-align: center;
    margin-bottom: 0;
    padding: .3em;
}
article p {
    padding: .5em;
}

```
Exactly the way it was. Nesting Css is a great tool for us as developers to clearly see how css is being applied. 
For small projects this probably isnt a big deal. But for large scale applications it can be a life saver. 

***

Now lets jump into some more advanced topics. 

### Partials & Imports

#### Partials https://git.generalassemb.ly/daltonhart/Intro-Sass/blob/master/README.md#partials--imports

A partial is a small snippet of css saved into a seperate sass file for use of importing into other files. The main use of this is to modularize your code and make it easier to manage. To create a partial you simply name your Sass file with a leading underscore.

```
_partial.scss // we know it is partial since underscore `_`
```
This underline tells Sass that this is a file that awaits an import before being compiled into a css file. 

#### Import

The import abilty allows us to import partials into our Sass code. 

With standard css everytime you use @import it creates an HTTP request for each css file. Sass improves this by compiling the partials into one css file so the browser only runs a single HTTP request. Simple to use and efficiant. 

##### How to use 

To import a partial you will be using the @import property. 

Let's test it out! Add the following line to your main.scss 

```scss

@import 'base';

```
If you imported correctly you will see the css inside of _base.scss applied to your css file. But, wait...

Why did we just put 'base' instead of _base.scss? Sass is smart enough to know that by using import you are requesting a partial and will automatically call upon the correct file without having to be so exact saving coding time once again! 

So where does the css go that you import? 

Where ever you import the partial it will be added into the css at that level. With that ability you can easily save several partials and call upon them inside your code and know as a fact that it will be where you want to render. 

***

### Extend/Inheritance: @extend %alert-style;

This is one of the coolest features dealing with Sass. Using @extend lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. In other words you basically create a variable object that hold css properties! This is a great way to keep your css very DRY and well organized. 

Syntax 

```scss

%alert-style {
    width: 20vw;
    height: 20vh;
}

.message{
    @extend %alert-style;
    background-color: white;
}

.error{
    @extend %alert-style;
    background-color: red;
}

```

Because we are 'extending' the styles of alert-style we can have the message and error classes inherit said styles. 

***

### Operators SCSS

That's right we can do math in css! 

![wat](https://media.giphy.com/media/tu54GM19sqJOw/giphy.gif)

This is more useful then you might think. Sass has a handful of standard math operators like +, -, *, /, and %. With these operators we can create more dynamic css. As an example we will use it to calculate the sizes for an article and an aside. 

```scss

.container { width: 100%; }

article {
  float: left;
  width: 600px / 960px * 100%;
}

aside {
  float: right;
  width: 300px / 960px * 100%;
}

```

What we were able to do was create a grid based on 960px and convert them into exact percentages. When the sass renders out it will look like so..

```css

.container {
  width: 100%;
}

- GIT: Removing files from a repository's history
if you have environment on turn it off (when working with Flask)
> remove the files out of your git holder (put it outside of folder)
> deactivate
> git rm --cached -r key_zom.py
> git commit --amend -CHEAD
* https://help.github.com/en/articles/removing-files-from-a-repositorys-history
* https://github.com/Borgaard/sf-wdi-51-assignments

- Removing a file added in the most recent unpushed commit
If the file was added with your most recent commit, and you have not pushed to GitHub, you can delete the file and amend the commit:

Open Terminal.

Change the current working directory to your local repository.

To remove the file, enter git rm --cached:

$ git rm --cached giant_file
# Stage our giant file for removal, but leave it on disk
Commit this change using --amend -CHEAD:

$ git commit --amend -CHEAD
# Amend the previous commit with your change
# Simply making a new commit won't work, as you need
# to remove the file from the unpushed history as well
Push your commits to GitHub:

$ git push
# Push our rewritten, smaller commit

- python basic: https://www.udemy.com/python-and-flask-bootcamp-create-websites-using-flask/learn/lecture/9340860#overview
  - @app.route() key is the decorator, whatever parameter passed into the decorator determines the URL extension that will link to the function (aka: view)
  - point: from root domain, we add on to this, we are passing in a string to create that route for the application.
    - @app.route("/some_page") => (translates) localhost:500/some_page
      once deployed => www.sitce.com/some_page

- Dynamic routing <name>
@app.route('/some_page/<name>')
def other_page(name):
  #later we will use this parameter with templates!!
  return 'User: {}'.format(name)
  or 
  return f'User: {name}'
```
@app.route('/puppy/<name>')
def puppy(name): # in this view function it takes in name variable that was supply to URL
  return f'<h1>This is a page for {name}</h1>'


# Make it upper case!
@app.route('/puppy/<name>')
def puppy(name): # in this view function it takes in name variable that was supply to URL
  return f'Uppercase: {name.upper()}</h1>'

```

- when developing set debug=True
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
  app.run(debug=True)
```
but when done set it no debug: 

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
  app.run()
```

### basic excercise to change y - latin sounding name:
from flask import Flask
from flask import request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
  return "<h1>Go to /puppy_name/name to see result</h1>"

@app.route('/puppy_name/<name>')
def puppylatin(name):
  # build a str
  pupname = ''

# last char ends with y?
  if name[-1] == 'y':
    # then pupname > copy all the way upto not including last letter
    pupname = name[:-1] + 'iful'
  else:
    # name we passed in + concatenate with y
    pupname = name + 'y'

  # finally return the puppy latin name
  return f'<h1>your new latin name is {pupname}</h1>'


if __name__ == '__main__':
  app.run(debug=True)

- Flask templates:
* Flask will look for HTML templates inside templates directory.

- <img src="../static/puppy_pic.jpg" alt="">
file travel, go back up a folder find the static folder > get the puppy photo
  - how to render static photo img in flask? 
    <img src="../static/puppy_pic.jpg" alt="">

- Jinja templating - allow us directly insert variables from our python code to the HTML file
  - syntax for inserting var: {{ some_var }}
  

- Jinja templating ex:
from flask import Flask, render_template
from flask import request

# create flask application 
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
  some_variable = "Fanny!"
  # we are injecting Fanny Python variable some_variable into simple.html
  return render_template('simple.html', my_var=some_variable)


if __name__ == '__main__':
  app.run(debug=True)

in templates/simple.html)
  <h1>HI! {{my_var}}</h1> 

- python list() -> method that separates the string and make it into a 
  list array list("Jose") => ['J', 'o', 's', 'e']

@app.route('/')
def index():
  name = "Fanny!"
  letters = list(name)
  # we are injecting Fanny Python variable some_variable into simple.html
  return render_template('simple.html', name=name, letters=letters)
  <h1>{{letters[0]}}</h1>
  => F

- slicing: start index 2 go to the end.
  name = "Fanny!"
  letters = list(name)
{{letters[2:]}}
=> ['n', 'n', 'y', '!']

- ok to pass variable and not use it
@app.route('/')
def index():
  name = "Fanny!"
  letters = list(name)
  pup_dictionary = {'pup_nam':'Sammy'}
  # we are injecting Fanny Python variable some_variable into simple.html
  return render_template('simple.html', name=name, letters=letters, pup_dictionary=pup_dictionary)

<body>
  <h1>HI! {{name}}</h1>
  <h1>{{letters[2:]}}</h1> // slicing from index 2 to upto end
</body>

-   return render_template('simple.html', name=name, letters=letters, pup_dictionary=pup_dictionary)
<body>
  <h1>HI! {{name}}</h1>
  <h1>{{letters[2:]}}</h1>
  <h1>{{pup_dictionary}}</h1> // {{}} is indication that we are injecting from flask application
  <h1>{{pup_dictionary['pup_name']}}</h1>  // call the key of python dictionary ['pup_name']

- control flow Jinga templating: {% %} use for if, for loop
  - templates folder must spelled correctly!!

<ul>  // we want to put the for in loop inside of unordered list b/c we don't want it terminate before we end.
  {% for item in mylist %}
  <li>{{ item }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

- mobile friendly tap buttons links, 10 millimeters wide or half an inch - works out about 40 css px.
  * fat fingers, fat thumbs: at least give 48px x 48px
  Tap targets should be bigger than the average finger.  To ensure all of your elements are at least that size, add `min-height: 48px;`
  `min-width: 48px;` to every tappable element.

  `height`, `width` alone can be dangerous b/c it won't allow the element to resize if the content inside of it is bigger than the container.

```
nav a, button { // button for tap fat fingers 10mm (half inch), 40css px
  min-height: 48px;
  min-width: 48px;
}
```

I know most if not all of us are familiar with DataCamp as a resource, but I wanted to highlight a couple of courses in particular that I found really useful:
1. ARIMA modeling in R (I'm sure the Python one is good too, and you don't really need to know much R to follow along). This was great in terms of providing a simple framework for how to do a time-series project, from EDA to forecasting.https://www.datacamp.com/courses/arima-modeling-with-r

@NS @Tevin Rawls @MarcusJHunter As you guys are out, we pushed review sessions that were scheduled for today, instead we worked on following programming questions-
```Write a function to return true if a given number is prime; WAF that returns true if the given String is a palindrome; WAF that prints repeated characters in the given string;```
. Go through these questions whenever you get time. Let me know if there any doubts.

step1)
`brew uninstall node`

step 2)  setting up local node here:
`nvm local`

step 3) // check node version: you want to see “V10.15.0”
`nvm current`


step 4) // finally check if node exist

for those that are getting node & nvm installed and working, then opening a new terminal window and finding it no longer working, try this:
first type
```$ whoami```
_note `$` shows you the command you're about to type is a command prompt; the command goes in terminal, not the `$`_

next, edit this command to include _your whoami username_ instead of mine ("gaardn"), then paste in terminal.
```export NVM_DIR="/Users/gaardn/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"```

//  https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/27851/after-installing-oh-my-zsh-zshrcsource34-no-such-file-or-directory
Make the executable, executable.

> cd .oh-my-zsh/ && chmod 744 oh-my-zsh.sh
Then run `exec zsh` to restart your shell. If you don't get the error, and your selected theme is working, you are good to go.

> Make it your default shell: chsh -s $(which zsh)

** Oh-My-Zsh is a framework for Zsh, the Z shell.

In order for Oh-My-Zsh to work, Zsh must be installed.
Please run zsh --version to confirm.
Expected result: zsh 5.1.1 or more recent
Additionally, Zsh should be set as your default shell.
Please run echo $SHELL from a new terminal to confirm.
Expected result: /usr/bin/zsh or similar

@sharonji: Check out the tests directory, the spec directory should be in there. Jasmine's a testing framework, you can check some documentation here: http://jasmine.github.io/2.3/introduction.html

A spec basically tests your code to make sure it's giving you the result you want, for example:

```describe("#getPlayerMove", function() {
  describe("when a move is given as a parameter", function() {
    it("should return that move", function(){
      expect(getPlayerMove('rock')).toEqual('rock');
      expect(getPlayerMove('paper')).toEqual('paper');```

hello! i'm wrapping up the Unit 4 homework, and saw this paragraph in the instruction:
Actually, this project has some tests built into it already, using a testing tool called Jasmine; to see the tests up close, just take a peek inside (but don't change!) the file RockPaperScissorsSpec.js, which sits inside the spec directory. These tests specify exactly how the code we write should behave - that's why they're called 'specs'!
Could someone help me understand what this is referring to? I'm looking for the Spec directory / file but can't find it. What is the Jasmine tool? Would love to be able to test it. Any additional references would be helpful too. Thanks so much!

Wondering if any of you can figure this out. When you make an array with length 0, Array(0), you obviously cannot join anything to it because it’s empty. But the same thing happens with an array of length 1, Array(1). If you try to join it still comes back empty.

Here’s a good tutorial on node and express! https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs
MDN Web Docs
Express web framework (Node.js/JavaScript)
Express is a popular unopinionated web framework, written in JavaScript and hosted within the Node.js runtime environment. The module explains some of the key benefits of this framework, how to set up your development environment and how to perform common web development and deployment tasks.
the intro https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction
MDN Web Docs
Express/Node introduction
Congratulations, you've completed the first step in your Express/Node journey! You should now understand Express and Node's main benefits, and roughly what the main parts of an Express app might look like (routes, middleware, error handling, and template code). You should also understand that with Express being an unopinionated framework, the way you pull these parts together and the libraries that you use are largely up to you!

Understanding the "this" keyword, call, apply, and bind in JavaScript
I could argue that one of the most misunderstood aspects of JavaScript is the 'this' keyword. In this video, we'll walk through five techniques for figuring out what the 'this' keyword is referencing. They are 1) Implicit Binding 2) Explicit Binding 3) new Binding 4) window Binding and 5) lexical binding. In covering these techniques we'll also cover some other confusing parts of JavaScript including call, apply, bind, and the new keyword.

thank you note
Last edited 13 days ago
For sending "Thank You" notes, there are two options you can take - I recommend doing both:

First - Follow-Up With Kelly
Draft a thank you note for each team that you interviewed with this week. After drafting those thank you notes, follow-up with Kelly by email.

I recommend sending Kelly (or whoever the Adobe point of contact was that sent you your interview schedule) a message that says something to the effect of - Hi Kelly! Thank you again for your communication throughout this process, I appreciate it! I wanted to follow up with a thank you note to the team/s I interviewed with. Is it possible to get a list of my interviewer's contact information so I can follow up with them individually? If not, I attached a thank you note for each team as a PDF so it can be shared out with the group. Thank you and let me know if there are any next steps I need to complete for the Digital Academy interview process. Thank you! -Jonathan

- Sass Essential
https://www.lynda.com/Sass-tutorials/Using-exercise-files/375925/435556-4.html?srchtrk=index%3a1%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3asass%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2

`gulp` command will automatically process the sass files for you

  - take the pre intro course up on git Running with Git and GitHub: https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/What-you-should-know/409275/416542-4.html?srchtrk=index%3a3%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3aup+and+running+git+and+github%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2

- git commonly used commands to start your own git file
> git init // begin git
> git add index.html // add individual files

> git commit -m "add new"
> git status // what is going on
> git log // tells you where you are at, log shows all the commits we have been making in our project.
> 

- git how to in/out of staging que
> git checkout index.html  // grab the file out of staging environment which grabs the prev version of the file > then it overwrote the changes that we had just made.  this is how you pull whatever it is in staging environment and ignore the changes I just made in staging.  We now see inside of our work environment what last commit we made to git.  
- note git checkout command is very useful 
> git checkout . // all modified files revert back to original prev commit.

> staging environment in git
gives more control of your files
// first change the file
> git add index.html
> git staus

> git reset HEAD index.html
// this revert it out of add recording env and 
// go to file and change it to something else
It will get you to skip prev save and overwrite to newest file save. 

- git delete! it is same as good old file change in git
//first delete a file about.html
> git status
> git checkout about.html // undelete about.html
// go back and delet the file again
> git add about.html // to put it in staging
> git reset HEAD about.html // go back on delete and unstage the change for git to follow up
> git status // you will see file is still unstage after reset HEAD command
> git rm about.html // deleting file, move all into staging
> git reset HEAD about.html // unstage the about.html deletion from the staging
> git checkout about.html // This is to take it out of staging environment (before git add state) and work environment.  Like it is a undelete.  nothing went on.
* shortcut: 
  > git rm about.html // remove the file on your desktop and issuing the git add command all in one line of code!! shortcut!
> git add --all // changes and deletion gets to be in staging environment
> git reset HEAD about.html // unstage about.html deletion
> git checkout about.html // undo the deletion
> git status // all is clean
```
- sandbox environment
> git checkout bb5bd9ef1fb064f16799c4832c1ba0cede487f0c
// bring back to earlier commit state and you can do sandbox experiment w/o effecting the entire project.
> git log 
// make some changes to file
> git add .
> git commit -m "alternate sandbox"

    revision one

// now when you are done fooling around you can go back to the regular git area, 
// git keeps all altanative universes in branches.
// let's go back to real world master branch
> git branch // where am I in the branch?  in the sandbox branch you can see it on the hash number
> git checkout master 
// notice the warning Warning: you are leaving 1 commit behind, not connected to
any of your branches:

  c0cf6b9 alternate sandbox

If you want to keep it by creating a new branch, this may be a good time
to do so with:

 git branch <new-branch-name> c0cf6b9  // sandbox branch

// we do'nt care about the sandbox branch so  
> git log // all the normal master branch logs
> git branch alternate c0cf6b9 // creating new branch with earlier hash
> git branch // see which branch you are on
> git checkout alternate // hop on to alternate branch
> git branch // now we are on new alternate branch

- git branch more 
// we really like the work we've done so far and we can always come back to the state.  Let's create a branch
> git branch app01

# basic-react

- tiny react app
https://codepen.io/heggy231/pen/ZZwZJa

class App extends React.Component {
  state = { styleOne: {}, styleTwo:{} };
  
  onMouseMove = (event) => {
    this.setState({
      styleOne: transform(-event.clientX / event.clientY),
      styleTwo: transform(event.clientX / event.clientY)
    })
  }
  // use method called render method
  render() {
    return (
      <div onMouseMove={this.onMouseMove}>
        <div className="panel" style={this.state.styleOne}/>
        <div className="panel" style={this.state.styleTwo}/>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.querySelector('#root')
)

- pen setting babel, react, reactdom

1) install node on your machine
2) > npm install -g create-react-app
3) > create-react-app jsx

- Purpose of React
  * JS lib
  * ultimate purpose: show HTML content to users and handle user interaction

  class - es15

- JSX: looks like HTML and can be placed in JS Code.  
* react Components are used for
  - event handler: used when user interact > update our component.
https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/lecture/12531050#overview

- Why did we add two separate react lib
React is split into 2 libraries.
1) React: component is deflined, stitches up many components together
2) ReactDOM: take components > renders it to DOM

- react project directory
react > src -> folder where we put all the source code we write.
react > public -> static files html images or music things that don't change
react > node_modules => Folder that contains all our project dependencies
react > package.json => Records our project dependencies and configures our project
react > package-lock.json => Records the exact version of packages that we install
readme.md => instructions on how to use this project.

> npm start // starts react app

- build something in react!
1) under src folder delete all
2) outline what we are about to build: stuff to show up on the browser:
  // Import the React and ReactDOM libraries
  import React from 'react';
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

  // Create a react component
  const App = () => {
    return <div>Hi There!</div>
  };

  // Take the react component and show it on the screen
  ReactDOM.render(
    <App />,
    document.querySelector('#root')
  );

import React <variable we are assign to> from <lib we are importing from> 'react'< name of the dependency or path to the file we are importing>

component is 1) function or 2) class -> produces HTML to show the user (using JSX) ->

redux-code
https://github.com/StephenGrider/redux-code

prettier format code
https://prettier.io/docs/en/cli.html

Terminal:

I use Iterm2 as my terminal - https://www.iterm2.com/

Inside my terminal, I run the shell https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh with the default theme 'Robby Russell'


- input of id of name
<div>
<!--  label attribute for="name" associate to input with id="name" 
what this does when click on label > cursor goes inside name input field 
-->
  <label for="name">Enter name:</label>
  <input id="name" />
  <button>Submit</button>
</div>

- return (); jsx convention for multi-line return statement

remember to start react 
> npm start // start react app

in HTML)any dash remove and camelCase things into JSX
HTML: <div style="background-color: red;"></div>
JSX: <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'red' }}>
  // first curly { } << Javascript
  // Second curly { } << object of JS

HTML: <div style="border: 1px solid red;"></div>
JSX: <div style={{ border: '1px solid red' }}></div>
  // first curly { } << Javascript
  // Second curly { } << object of JS
      remember value in object must be a string!


HTML: <button style="background-color: blue; color: white;">Submit</button>
JSX: <button style={{ backgroundColor: 'blue',
                                color: 'white' }}>Submit</button>


      <label className="label" for="name">Enter Name: </label>
      <input id="name" type="text"/>
      <button style={{ backgroundColor: 'blue', color: 'white' }}>Submit</button>

- Why do we have to convert class="label" to className="label"?
    class App extends React.Component << we are using es15 class so we don't want collision

- JSX can reference JS variables:
    We can inject JS and use it inside of JSX.
1) define js variable above the return ()

  const App = () => {
  
  const buttonText = 'Click Me!'; // js variable

  return (


2) put curly inside of JSX {}

    <button style={{ backgroundColor: 'blue', color: 'white' }}>
      {}
    </button>

3) insert JS variable

    <button style={{ backgroundColor: 'blue', color: 'white' }}>
      {buttonText}
    </button>

- multiple interpolation: 
interpolation: 
1) insertion of something of a different nature into something else
" the interpolation of songs into the piece "
2) a remark interjected in a conversation
" as the evening progressed their interpolations became more ridiculous "

ex in react:
const labelText = 'Enter name:'

return (
  <div>
    <label className="label" for="name">
      {labelText}
    </label>
  </div>
)

- get the local time now js:
function getTime() {
	return (new Date()).toLocaleTimeString();
}

> JavaScript Date() object 
new Date(2018, 01, 24, 10, 33, 30, 0);
// output => Sat Feb 24 2018 10:33:30 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)
// Note 01 month is Feb since zero based index. 

-- react to get Date() object to work
<script type="text/babel" data-presets="env,react">
    function getTime() {
        return (new Date()).toLocaleTimeString()
    }

    // Creates a functional component
    const App = () => {
        return (
            <div>
                <div>Current Time:</div>
                <h3>{getTime()}</h3>
            </div>
        );
    }

    // Renders the App component into a div with id 'root'
    ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector('#root'));
</script>

- 3 tenets of Components: (tenets of react ecosystem )
1) Component Nesting: A component can be shown inside of another
2) Component Reusability: We want to make components that can be easily reused thru out application
3) Component Configuration: We should be able to configure a component when it is created.
ex) click on me, customize it when created with text button

- for photos we will use faker js
  https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/
  how to install faker js in your file? 
  > npm install --save faker // this will save in your dependencies file so when you d/l your project it willl again know to get the fakerjs files

  > npm install -g npm // new npm is out!
  > import faker from 'faker'; // put this top of your react index.js to install dependencies

  to use it in react
  > <img alt="avatar" src={faker.image.avatar()}/> // {} << it is javascript variable, 
  how to user fakerjs as node js:  https://github.com/Marak/faker.js/blob/master/Readme.md#nodejs
  - Node.js:
    var faker = require('faker');

    var randomName = faker.name.findName(); // Rowan Nikolaus
    var randomEmail = faker.internet.email(); // Kassandra.Haley@erich.biz
    var randomCard = faker.helpers.createCard(); // random contact card containing many properties

example:
- index.js)
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import faker from 'faker';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="ui container comments">
      <div className="comment">
        <a href="/" className="avatar">
          <img alt="avatar" src={faker.image.avatar()}/>
        </a>
        <div className="content">
          <a href="/" className="author">
            Sam
          </a>
          <div className="metadata">
            <span className="date">Today at 6:00PM</span>
          </div>
          <div className="text">Nice blog post!</div>

  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector('#root'));

- Extracting JSX as component:
1) ID the JSX that appears to be duplicated.

        <a href="/" className="avatar">
          <img alt="avatar" src={faker.image.avatar()}/>
        </a>
        <div className="content">
          <a href="/" className="author">
            Sam
          </a>
          <div className="metadata">
            <span className="date">Today at 6:00PM</span>
          </div>
          <div className="text">Nice blog post!</div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div className="comment">
        <a href="/" className="avatar">
          <img alt="avatar" src={faker.image.avatar()}/>
        </a>
        <div className="content">
          <a href="/" className="author">
            Sam
          </a>
          <div className="metadata">
            <span className="date">Today at 6:00PM</span>
          </div>
          <div className="text">Nice blog post!</div>
        </div>
      </div>

2) What is the purpose of that block of JSX?  Think of a descriptive name for what it does
  - think of why this single component exist?  for us detail about a single comment: Name: component: comment detail
  Nomencrature: CommentDetail (uppcase each word wth camel casing)

3) Create new file to house this new component - it should have the same name as the component.  Create a new compoent in the new file, paste the JSX into it.

  inside of ComponentDetails.js)
  import React from 'react';

  const CommentDetail () => {
    return (
      <div className="comment">
        <a href="/" className="avatar">
          <img alt="avatar" src={faker.image.avatar()}/>
        </a>
        <div className="content">
          <a href="/" className="author">
            Sam
          </a>
          <div className="metadata">
            <span className="date">Today at 6:00PM</span>
          </div>
          <div className="text">Nice blog post!</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  };
  
4) pass props: props system: having a parent customize how the child looks or behaves.  Props main function pass data from parent to child.

- Props:
  System for passing data from a parent component to a child component.
  Goal is to customize or configure a child component.  

any hard coded things such as author name, date, text
so when we use the components we want dynamic data and here Props are
here to work it.

- 2 stage of Props: 
  1) System for passing data from a parent component to a child component.
  2) Goal is to customize or configure a child component.

  > <a href="/" className="author">
      Sam
    </a>
  > <CommentDetail author="Sam" />
    author << Name of the props, "Sam" << Value of the prop

  We can also reference value as js variable
  > author = {author}  // name of the prop = value of the prop

how to send down info from parent to child using props
1) provide information from parent
> <CommentDetail author="Sam" />
2) consume information at child level
> Inside of child component, provide props as obj:
> const CommentDetail = props => {  }

- relative path to get to the component file
import CommentDetail from './CommentDetail';
here ./ is saying same folder . is to to parent of this directory is /

Note: CommentDetail.js we don't need to put .js since Webpack will find the .js kind file for you.

- when injecting component inside of index.js of another component
just use angle bracekt! <CommentDetail />

  const App = () => {
    return (
      <div className="ui container comments">
        <CommentDetail />

      </div>
    );
  };


import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import faker from 'faker';
import CommentDetail from './CommentDetail';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="ui container comments">
      <CommentDetail />
      <CommentDetail />
      <CommentDetail />
      <CommentDetail />
    </div>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector('#root'));
* this is called instance of component nesting.
  each props pass bit of configuration to each of those common components.

* props system: having a parent customize how the child looks or behaves.

- current app's component hierarchy
app | (app is parent)
    |
    |- - (nested child components) Comment Detail
    |- - (nested child components) Comment Detail
    |- - (nested child components) Comment Detail

* Props system:
system that pass data from parent component to child component
  - Goal: customize or configure a child component

app | (app is parent)
    |
    |- - (nested child components) Comment Detail
    |- - (nested child components) Comment Detail
    |- - (nested child components) Comment Detail
  
- What you will see as console:
- inside of index.js)

      <CommentDetail author="Alex" />
      <CommentDetail author="Jane" />
    </div>
  );
};

  console.log(props);
  return (
    <div className="comment">
      <a href="/" className="avatar">

        </div>
        <div className="text">Nice blog post!</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CommentDetail;

> Object 1, 2, 3, with key "author" value of Sam, Alex, Jane

- Now time to consume the data we passing down from parent to child

- convert all hard data into props
index.js)
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import faker from 'faker';
import CommentDetail from './CommentDetail';

const App = () => {

- build weather app:
> cd .. // go up a level
> create-react-app seasons
> cd seasons
> npm start // start development server

- APP (Has code to determine location + month) --> It's Summer --> SeasonDisplay (shows different text/icons based on props)

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API

- when you are in console tab: press esc to and dot dot dot to get the sensor (geolcation > sf)
* index.js)
  import React from 'react';
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

  const App = () => {
    window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      (position) => console.log(position), 
      (err) => console.log(err)
    );

    return <div>Hi there!</div>;
  }

  ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector('#root'));

- TIME Y axis
1) JS file loaded by browser
2) APP component gets created
const App = () => {
  window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
    (position) => console.log(position), 
    (err) => console.log(err)
  );

  return <div>Latitude: </div>;
}

3) Call geolocation service
4) App returns JSX, gets rendered to page as HTML
5) We get result of geolocation!
6) Tell the component to render itself with this new information


Rules of Class components:
1) Must be JS Class
2) Must extend (subclass) React.Component
3) Must define a 'render' method that returns some amount of JSX

index.js)
// class based component
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {  
    window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
    (position) => console.log(position), 
    (err) => console.log(err)
  );
    return <div>Latitude: </div>
  }
}


ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector('#root'));

- Rules of State:
  * Only usable with class components (also can be used with functional components using the 'hooks' system)
  * You will confuse props with state ;()
  * `State` is JS obj that contatins data relevant to a component
  * Updating `state` on a component causes the component to (almost) instantly rerender.
  * State must be initialized when a component is created.
  * State can only be updated using the function `setState`

Rule of react: React says we must define render() every App class
class App extends React.Component {

  // React requires we have to define render method!!
  render() {  

- how to define constructor inside of app
class App extends React.Component {
  // define constructor > must call super
  constructor(props) {
    // ceremonial part when doing constructor function
    super(props);

  }

  * Next we can now initialize state:
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      lat: null
    }
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Latitude: {this.state.lat} </div>;
  }

  * only put things that needs to be called often.   
  - We are removing 
  window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      position => console.log(position), 
      err => console.log(err)
    );
  - place it outside of render()

  class App extends React.Component {
  // define constructor > to initialize 
  constructor(props) {
    // ceremonial part when doing constructor function
    // super() calls for parent constructor function from React.Component 
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      // sensible to assign null when we don't know what to assign
      lat: 40
    };
    window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      position => console.log(position), 
      err => console.log(err)
    );
  }

  // React requires we have to define render method!!
  render() {  
    return <div>Latitude: {this.state.lat} </div>;
  }
}

* Summary As we use state to update the data in react
1) remember to create class that extends React.Component
2) put render() method that returns JSX
3) define constructor(props) then call parent constructor function
    `super(props)`
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class App extends React.Component {
  // define constructor > to initialize 
  constructor(props) {
    // ceremonial part when doing constructor function
    // super() calls for parent constructor function from React.Component 
    super(props);
    // This is only TIME we do direct assignment to this state
    this.state = {
      // sensible to assign null when we don't know what to assign
      lat: 40
    };
    window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      position => {
        // We called setstate!!
        this.setState({ lat: position.coords.latitude });
      }, 
      err => console.log(err)
    );
  }

  // React requires we have to define render method!!
  render() {  
    return <div>Latitude: {this.state.lat} </div>;
  }
}


ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector('#root'));

- flow diagram: summary
1) JS file loaded by browser:
2) Instance of App Component is created:
`class App extends React.Component`
3) App components 'constructor' function gets called:  (first function that gets calle in App component is constructor function)
`constructor(props) {
    // ceremonial part when doing constructor function
    // super() calls for parent constructor function from React.Component 
    super(props);
    };`
4) State obj is created and assigned to the 'this.state' property:
  `this.state = { lat: null }`
5) We call geolocation service:
// this gets called some point in time in the future.
  `window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      position => {
        // We called setstate!!
        this.setState({ lat: position.coords.latitude });
      }, 
      err => console.log(err)
    );`
6) React calls the components render method:
  render() {}
7) App returns JSX, gets rendered to page as HTML

** waiting for geolocation to come back with result.

8) We get result of geolocation!!

9) we update our state obj with a call to `this.setState`
  this.setState({ lat: position.coords.latitude });
  // remember when we update our state, React will update state property.

10) React calls our `render` method a 2nd time.
11) Render method returns some (updated) JSX.
12) React takes that JSX and updates content on the screen.

* error handling:
  - how are you going to re-render? thru our state

  window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      position => {
        // We called setstate!!
        this.setState({ lat: position.coords.latitude });
      }, 
      err => {
        this.setState({ errorMessage: err.message });
      }

-- inside of App{} 
    this.state = {
      // sensible to assign null when we don't know what to assign
      lat: null, 
      errorMessage: ''
    };

    window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      position => {
        // We called setstate!!
        this.setState({ lat: position.coords.latitude });
      }, 
      err => {
        this.setState({ errorMessage: err.message }); // err.message is the property inside of error which is a part of geolocation err property
      }
    );

    render() {  
    return (
      <div>
        Latitude: {this.state.lat}
        <br />
        Error: {this.state.errorMessage}
      </div>
    );
  }

- different cases of error, latitude
* Have latitude | No errorMessage --> show latitude
* No latitude | Have errorMessage --> show error (denied geolocation request - this.state.errorMessage)
* No latitude | No errorMessage --> show "loading"

-- before the if else statement
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class App extends React.Component {
  // define constructor > to initialize 
  constructor(props) {
    // ceremonial part when doing constructor function
    // super() calls for parent constructor function from React.Component 
    super(props);
    // This is only TIME we do direct assignment to this state
    this.state = {
      // sensible to assign null when we don't know what to assign
      lat: null, 
      errorMessage: ''
    };
    window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      position => {
        // We called setstate!!
        this.setState({ lat: position.coords.latitude });
      }, 
      err => {
        this.setState({ errorMessage: err.message });
      }
    );
  }

  // React requires we have to define render method!! return JSX
  render() {  
    return (
      <div>
        Latitude: {this.state.lat}
        <br />
        Error: {this.state.errorMessage}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector('#root'));

--- after adding if/else:
  3 different cases:

    * No latitude && No errorMessage --> show latitude
      !Latitude: {this.state.lat} && Error: {this.state.errorMessage}

    * Have latitude && Have errorMessage --> show error (denied geolocation request - this.state.errorMessage)
      Latitude: {this.state.lat} && !Error: {this.state.errorMessage}

    * No latitude && No errorMessage --> show "loading"
      !Latitude: {this.state.lat} && !Error: {this.state.errorMessage}

  render() {
    if(this.state.errorMessage && !this.state.lat) {
      return <div>Error: {this.state.errorMessage}</div>;
    }
    if (!this.state.errorMessage && this.state.lat) {
      return <div>Latitude: {this.state.lat}</div>;
    }
    return <div>Loading</div>;
  }

- component Lifecycle method is a function we can define class based component
Component LifeCycle: 
  1) constructor 
    (Good place for initialize state, good place for one-time setup: initial data loading.)
  2) render (Not optional!!)
    (ONLY JSX.  Avoid doing anything besides returning JSX: `<div>  </div>`
      - do not try to get user's locations
      like DO NOT DO THIS HERE: `window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()`
    )

  3) `componentDidMount` is called when:
    *** Content visible on screen ***
    (** Great for initial data loading for your component.  Only gets invoked one time.  Great for initial data loading for your component such as get the user location one time.  DO IT HERE 
    
    componentDidMount: // this gets invoked only once
      `window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()`
    )
    after class App{}, before render()
    class App{}
    componentDidMount() {
      // content visible on screen and now the componentDidMount() method is called.

    }
    render()

    // Note: you can perform user location look up under constructor or componentDidMount.  BestPractices is to call one-time data loading inside of `componentDidMount()`
    - this leads to clear code.  next person will look at componentDidMount() for one time data loading function inside here not in both places (constructor or componentDidMount)


  4) `componentDidUpdate`: 
    // sits and wait for updates...
    Good place to do more data-loading when state/props change.  everytime new update it gets render with new info.  ex) make network request everytime user clicks on the button or every single time we get new props from parent component.  Multiple data loading componentDidUpdate is great place to put.  
    *** Sit and wait for updates (re-render) ***
    componentDidUpdate() {
      // setState() menthod will re-render(), first render() method will be called.
    }

  5) `componentWillUnmount`:
    *** Sit and wait until this component is not longer shown ***
    Good place to do **cleanup** (especially for non-React stuff)

    componentWillUnmount() {
      // when we decide to stop showing update for the component for update.
    }

- Try out componentDidMount()
// after content rendered to the screen.

  class App extends React.Component {
    // define constructor > to initialize 
    constructor(props) {
      // ceremonial part when doing constructor function
      // super() calls for parent constructor function from React.Component 
      super(props);
      // This is only TIME we do direct assignment to this state
      this.state = {
        // sensible to assign null when we don't know what to assign
        lat: null, 
        errorMessage: ''
      };
      window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
          // We called setstate!!
          this.setState({ lat: position.coords.latitude });
        }, 
        err => {
          this.setState({ errorMessage: err.message });
        }
      );
    }

    componentDidMount() {
      console.log('My component was rendered to the screen.');
    }

    // React requires we have to define render method!! return JSX
    render() {
      if (this.state.errorMessage && !this.state.lat) {
        return <div>Error: {this.state.errorMessage}</div>;
      }

      if (!this.state.errorMessage && this.state.lat) {
        return <div>Latitude: {this.state.lat}</div>;
      }

      return <div>Loading!</div>;
    }
  }

-- convert into single line fat arrow.
* End point:
  componentDidMount() {
    // console.log('My component was rendered to the screen.');
    window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      position => this.setState({ lat: position.coords.latitude }), 
      err => this.setState({ errorMessage: err.message })
    );
  }
* Starting point:
  window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
    position => {
      // We called setstate!!
      this.setState({ lat: position.coords.latitude });
    }, 
    err => {
      this.setState({ errorMessage: err.message });
    }
  );

- converting it into constructor function

  constructor(props) {
    // ceremonial part when doing constructor function
    // super() calls for parent constructor function from React.Component 
    super(props);
    // This is only TIME we do direct assignment to this state
    this.state = {
      // sensible to assign null when we don't know what to assign
      lat: null, 
      errorMessage: ''
    };
  }

  // this state is same as this.state inside of constructor(props)'s this.state
  state = { lat: null, errorMessage: '' };

> under presets pick: 
  stage-0, stage-1, stage-2, stage-3, react selected!!

Do NOT select anything else
try writing constructor,  Notice that babel just gives you exactly same!
```
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      lat: null
    }
  }
}
```

- passing props down from parent to child season:
  ```
  import SeasonDisplay from './SeasonDisplay';

  state = { 
    lat: null, 
    errorMessage: '' 
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      position => this.setState({ lat: position.coords.latitude }),
      err => this.setState({ errorMessage: err.message });
    );
  }

  render() {
    return <seasonDisplay lat={this.state.lat} />
  }

  ```

- now refactor SeasonDiplay to receive the parent props:
```
  // when receiving props Make sure to pass the props
  inside of SeasonDisplay)

  const SeasonDiaplay = (props) => {
    // parent is passing down lat={this.state.lat}
    console.log(props.lat);
    return <div>Season Display: </div>;
  }

  export default SeasonDisplay;
```

Window Manager
While programming it's pretty common to need to juggle the placement of multiple windows. To speed up this process, we'll install a program that does this for us (and gives us a bunch of convenient keyboard shortcuts).

Download https://raw.github.com/onsi/ShiftIt/master/ShiftIt.zip

Next, extract it and drag the application icon into your Applications directory.
Finally, launch the app by right-clicking on the ShiftIt icon and click open, follow the instructions to enable the accessibility options.
We recommend you familiarze yourself with ShiftIt commands and keyboard shortcuts, like:

Move window to the left-half: Command+Option+Control+LeftArrow
Move window to the right-half: Command+Option+Control+RightArrow
Maximize a window: Command+Option+Control+M

- How to convert from functional component to class based component?
1) replace `const` to `class`
const UserFom ==> class UserForm

2) extend to React.Component
const UserForm = () => {} // functional 
class UserForm extends React.Component {} // class based component

3) wrap the return stmt inside of render method:
render () {
  return ( // jsx
    <form>
      <label>Enter a username:</label>
      <input />
    </form>
  );
}

4) Final:
class UserForm extends React.Component {
  render() {

- event handler event listener REACT Whenever input field has a change > onChange prop get the value few react based eventListner
REACT events:  when we pass function to onChange > it will be called automatically > when user interacts with your website.  
Note you can click on div but you can not change div but input works with onChange.
Note onSubmit form can be submitted not div.

  1) onClick - User clicks on something  <a onClick={this.onUserClick}> </a>
    when user clicks on the element, the cb function will be called. 
  2) onChange  (in js keydown) - User changes text in an input field <input onChange={this.onInputChange}/>
    onChange(event) {
      cons
    }
  3) onSubmit - User submits a form (works with form element)
  <form onSubmit={this.onSubmission}>
    <input type="submit" />
  </form>

Naming convention: on Input (which element?) Change (what event are we watching for?)

- refactor of event handler function (single line of code arrow function):

option1) 
 <input type="text" onChange={ (e) => console.log(e.target.value) } />  // when you have single line of code that we want to execute anytime that some event occurs.  Note: no semi-colon here! 

 ########### OR ############# 

option2) 
 onInputChange (event) {
   console.log(event.target.value);
 }

 <input type="text" onChange={this.onInputChange} />

 - Controlled vs. Uncontrolled form element
 We react dev pref Controlled components

Uncontrolled Click event --> refactor to --> controlled element
  Flow 1. User Types in input
  Flow 2. Callback gets invoked
  Flow 3. We call setState with the new value
  Flow 4. Component rerenders
  Flow 5. Input is told what its value is (coming from state)

- React only Input value change: (https://codepen.io/heggy231/pen/ewJzYg)

What is controlled vs. uncontrolled: key difference: 

When uncontrolled:
  Q) What's the value of the input right now?
HTML World: 
  <input value="hi there" /> 
  // only thru DOM > document.getElementsByTagName('tag_name')[whole_number].value
vs
React World: React has no idea what value for user input.  We don't like to store 
  input value inside of HTML element.  


  Where you used to assign:
  class SearchBar extends React.Component {
    onInputChange() {
      console.log("input was clicked!")
    }

    render() {
      <input 
        type="text" 
        value={this.state.term} 
        onChange={this.onInputChange} 
      />
    }

  

  * Refactor to make it controlled (https://codepen.io/heggy231/pen/gNMMNJ?editors=1000)
  1) add the state
  2) <input value={this.state.term}
            onChange={ (e) => this.setState( 
              {term: e.target.value}
            )}
     />

* React World
State -> { term: 'hi there' }

* DOM World
<input value={go look at state to get current value} />

- once controlled you don't have to look at the DOM to see the value of the input.  but 
state has the value.
The reason of this and that we are driving and store all of the data. Not HTML input element.

  <input 
    type="text" 
    value={this.state.term} 
    onChange={ (e) => this.setState({ term: e.target.value }) }
  />

- Force user to only input upper case character
state = {
  term: 'enter your question',
}

render() {
  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={this.state.term}
      onChange={ (e) => this.setState({ term: e.target.value.toUpperCase() }) }
    />
  )
}

- Some other use cases for controlled components are good for: 1) radio buttons 2) check boxes 3) form inputs
* app.js)
import React from 'react';
import SearchBar from './SearchBar';

// functional component
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="ui container" style={{ marginTop: '10px' }}>
      <SearchBar />

- my addition:
<input 
  type="text"
  placeholder="enter something"
  value={this.state.term}
  // change user input force toUpperCase()
  // onChange={ (e) => this.setState({ term: e.target.value.toUpperCase() }) }
  onChange={ (e) => this.setState({ term: e.target.value }) }
/>

- What is `this` used for in a class?  How is the value of `this` determined in a function?
class SearchBar extends React.Component {
  state= {}

  onFormSubmit() {}

  render(){}
}

Instance of `SearchBar`:
  state
  render
  onFormSubmit

  this // give me the instance of SearchBar > which gives me access to state, render, onFormSubmit

- learning about this gets called inside of  https://stephengrider.github.io/playgrounds/
class SearchBar extends React.Component {
  state = {
    term: '',
  };

  onFormSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log(this.state.term);
  }

- Play to understand this:
class Car {
	setDriveSound(sound) {
  	this.sound = sound;
  }
  
  drive() {
  	return this.sound;
  }
}

- Note about constructor function using this.
// create a Person Constructor function
function Person(name) {
    // name - Heggy
    // species - Human
​
    this.name = name;
    this.species = 'human';
}

* next interation of this inside of constructor:
function Person(name) {
    // name - Heggy
    // species - Human
​   
    // this = {}; this is empty obj
    this.name = name;
    this.species = 'human';
    // at the end it will return this;
}

// to get ^^^above to work only in conjunction with new Keyword
new Person('Heggy')
* output => Person {name: "Heggy", species: "human"}
if you forget to put new keyword the this.name will be assigned to Window obj


-- next using constructor new keyword inside of class Car
class Car {
	setDriveSound(sound) {
  	this.sound = sound;
  }
  
  drive() {
  	return this.sound;
  }
}

// constructor function use key `new`.  shortcut to use obj
const car = new Car();
car.setDriveSound('vroom');
car.drive(); // if you want to see where this is getting set is left of the dot rule when the function is called.  so this is car obj since drive() was called on car.
=> "vroom"

const drive = car.drive;
drive()
=> VM1638:7 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'sound' of undefined
    at drive (<anonymous>:7:16)
    at <anonymous>:1:1

// when drive is called, it has nothing left of the the dot; therefore it is set to undefined.

when class is not extneding anything we don't have to write super.
class Car {
  constructor() {
    this.drive = this.drive.bind(this)
  }


}

- way to fix
class Car {
  constructor() {
  	this.drive = this.drive.bind(this);
  }
	setDriveSound(sound) {
  	this.sound = sound;
  }
  
  drive() {
  	return this.sound;
  }
}

// constructor function use key `new`.  shortcut to use obj
const car = new Car();
car.setDriveSound('vroom');
car.drive();

// => vroom

const truck = {
	sound: 'putputput',
  driveMyTruck: car.drive
}
truck.driveMyTruck();
// => 'putputput' left of the dot car.drive => 
//    this.sound => truck.sound => 'putputput'

const drive = car.drive;
drive();
// => there is nothing left of dot for x.drive() here!

* bind into the .bind once it is bind it is forever bound

class SearchBar extends React.Component {
  // control vs uncontrolled using state makes it control
  state = {
    // since state is controlling the data we can set the 
    //  initialization value.
    term: '',
  };

onFormSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log(this.state.term);
}

- is same as)

class SearchBar extends React.Component {
  // control vs uncontrolled using state makes it control
  state = {
    // since state is controlling the data we can set the 
    //  initialization value.
    term: '',
  };

onFormSubmit: function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log(this.state.term);
}

- Now we turn it into an arrow function to keep the this to, We are now assigning an arrow
  function)

class SearchBar extends React.Component {
  // control vs uncontrolled using state makes it control
  state = {
    // since state is controlling the data we can set the 
    //  initialization value.
    term: '',
  };

// Assign arrow function which auto sets this points to SearchBar this is now  
//  instance of SearchBar
onFormSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log(this.state.term);
}

- 3rd way to fix the this binding (call the arrow function within the form
)

- before)
<form onSubmit={this.onFormSubmit} className="ui form">

- after pass in arrow function and event obj) 
leave onFormSubmit method alone:

  onFormSubmit(event) {
    // stop form from submit (browser's default behavior)
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log(this.state.term);
  }

<form onSubmit={(event) => this.onFormSubmit(event)} className="ui form">

--- fixed with arrow function onFormSubmit()
import React from 'react';

class SearchBar extends React.Component {
  // control vs uncontrolled using state makes it control
  state = {
    // since state is controlling the data we can set the 
    //  initialization value.
    term: '',
  };
  /* regular method
  onFormSubmit(event) {
    // stop form from submit (browser's default behavior)
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log(this.state.term);
  }
  */

  // Assign arrow function which auto sets `this` points to SearchBar
  onFormSubmit = (event) => {
    // stop form from submit (browser's default behavior)
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log(this.state.term);
  }

  // onInputClick() {
  //   console.log("Input was clicked!")
  // }
  //  REMEMBER to add onClick={ this.onInputClick} 
  //   inside of input tag to get this function working

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="ui segment">    
        <form onSubmit={this.onFormSubmit} className="ui form">
          <div className="field">
            {/* label for the image search: Image Search */}
            <label>Image Search</label>
            {/* when refer to this.onInputChange remember to leave out () 
              We do mpt put () >> when we pass a callback function to an event handler
              - call .onInputChange() when user types anything on field which event.target.value get the info.

              - onChange: different events has different prop names, this case prop name: onChange
              - refactoring to controlled element vs Uncontrolled Click event earlier
              
              - value: whatever we assign to value the input will show
            */}
            <input 
              type="text"

export default SearchBar;


- Search term back upto the app component

Using Unsplash API:
- https://unsplash.com/documentation#search-photos

- 2 libraries for managing network requests and fetching some amount of data:
1) Axios (3rd party package)
  stand alone 3rd party package npm to install into a react project
2) Fetch (function built into modern browsers)
  built into all modern browser
  it will produce smaller in size since no package needs to be installed
  but it is more basic therefore you have to write more code.

- install axios (react pop networkwork request): npm install --save axios
import React from 'react';
import axios from 'axios'; // we put third party package above our file
import SearchBar from './SearchBar';
- axios react documentation: https://github.com/axios/axios
// Make a request for a user with a given ID
axios.get('/user?ID=12345') // get a endpoint for our api

- unsplash Schema > Location: (https://unsplash.com/documentation#location)
root of unsplash
`https://api.unsplash.com/`

- Search Photos endpoint: (https://unsplash.com/documentation#search-photos)
`GET /search/photos`

- Public Actions: (https://unsplash.com/documentation#public-actions)
https://unsplash.com/documentation#public-actions
1) Header approach:
Authorization: Client-ID YOUR_ACCESS_KEY

2) pass a value using a client_id query parameter:
https://api.unsplash.com/photos/?client_id=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
- under axios header request config obj
(https://github.com/axios/axios#request-config)
  // `headers` are custom headers to be sent
  headers: {'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest'},
  for Unsplash
  To authenticate requests in this way, pass your application’s access key via the HTTP Authorization header:
  // unsplash expects Authorization in the header and its Client-ID with access key value in string
  Authorization: Client-ID YOUR_ACCESS_KEY


  // `params` are the URL parameters to be sent with the request
  // Must be a plain object or a URLSearchParams object
  params: {
    ID: 12345
  },


- just using axios call:
class App extends React.Component {
  onSearchSubmit(term) {
    // api end point url and config optional argument
    axios
      .get('https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos', {
        // https://unsplash.com/documentation#parameters-11
        // what happens with params adds to the end of url https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?yourQueryTermValue  ex) https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?car
        // Request Config for Axios https://github.com/axios/axios#request-config
        params: { query: term },
        // header doc https://unsplash.com/documentation#public-actions
        headers: {
        //Authorization: Client-ID YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
          Authorization: 'Client-ID c60a2d465519232c93936ce432ae69a1d052aa60ee8dc5b01a22919ef699590c'
        }
    // after asynch axios network request promise obj get passed, arrow function is cb invoked with data we got back splash app
    })
    .then(response => {
      console.log(response.data.results);
    });
    
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="ui container" style={{ marginTop: '10px' }}>
        <SearchBar onSubmit={this.onSearchSubmit}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

- Using async with axios: By putting `async` infront of function name; we can use await request infront of network request axios.

class App extends React.Component {
  async onSearchSubmit(term) {
    const response = await axios
      .get('https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos', {
        headers: {
          Authorization: 'Client-ID c60a2d465519232c93936ce432ae69a1d052aa60ee8dc5b01a22919ef699590c'
        }
      });
    console.log(response.data.results);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="ui container" style={{ marginTop: '10px' }}>
        <SearchBar onSubmit={this.onSearchSubmit}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;

- error in this  when passing props from parent app to child

* App.js)
class App extends React.Component {
  // if expected to img in array default it empty array
  state = { images: [] };
  async onSearchSubmit(term) {
    // api end point url and config optional argument
    // await key word for anything that may makes network request
    const response = await axios
      .get('https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos', {

        headers: {
          Authorization: 'Client-ID c60a2d465519232c93936ce432ae69a1d052aa60ee8dc5b01a22919ef699590c'
        }
      });
    // console.log(response.data.results);
    console.log(this);
    this.setState({ images: response.data.results });
  }
  render() {
return (
      <div className="ui container" style={{ marginTop: '10px' }}>
      // here we are passing down prop down to SearchBar component
        <SearchBar 
          onSubmit={this.onSearchSubmit}
          guessWhtIam="Im the props objt!!"
        />
        Found: {this.state.images.length}
      </div>

* SearchBar.js)
class SearchBar extends React.Component {
  // control vs uncontrolled using state makes it control
  state = {
    // since state is controlling the data we can set the 
    //  initialization value.
    term: '',
  };
  /* regular method
  onFormSubmit(event) {
    // stop form from submit (browser's default behavior)
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log(this.state.term);
  }
  */

  // Assign arrow function which auto sets `this` points to SearchBar
  onFormSubmit = (event) => {
    // stop form from submit (browser's default behavior)
    event.preventDefault();
    this.props.onSubmit(this.state.term);  // 
  }

- convert regular funtion to arrow function to bind this keyword
  - before)
  async onSearchSubmit(term) {
    // api end point url and config optional argument
    // await key word for anything that may makes network request
    const response = await axios
      .get('https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos', {
        params: { query: term },
        headers: {
          Authorization: 'Client-ID c60a2d465519232c93936ce432ae69a1d052aa60ee8dc5b01a22919ef699590c'
        }
      });
    // console.log(response.data.results);
    console.log(this);
    this.setState({ images: response.data.results });
  }
  - after) move the async the other side of equal.
  // async onSearchSubmit(term) {
  onSearchSubmit = async (term) => {
    // api end point url and config optional argument
    // await key word for anything that may makes network request
    const response = await axios
      .get('https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos', {
        params: { query: term },
        headers: {
          Authorization: 'Client-ID c60a2d465519232c93936ce432ae69a1d052aa60ee8dc5b01a22919ef699590c'
        }
      });
    console.log(response.data.results);
    this.setState({ images: response.data.results });
  }


- create axios class custom:

import axios from 'axios';

// create a new instance of axios with a custom config https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios#axioscreateconfig
axios.create({
  headers: {
    baseURL: "https://api.unsplash.com/",
    Authorization: 'Client-ID c60a2d465519232c93936ce432ae69a1d052aa60ee8dc5b01a22919ef699590c'
  }
});

- passing down props App.js into ImageList.js:
* App.js)
import ImageList from './ImageList';

class App extends React.Component {
  state = { images: [] };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <ImageList images={this.state.images} />
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default App;

* ImageList.js:
import React from 'react';

const ImageList = (props) => {
  console.log(props.images); 
  // props.images => [ ] empty array; since it's getting the parent component from App (its parent container)

  return <div>Image List!</div>
}

------
### Array.map review
[1, 2, 7].map(function(num) {
	return num * 10;
});
// =>  [10, 20, 70]
each element of array gets transforms into new things and returns a brand new array.

- silly but this is also possible with Array
[1, 2, 7].map(function(num) {
	return true;
});

* another of map ex: (leave the original numbers alone but newNumber gets new transformed number)
const numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];
let newNumbers = [];

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
	newNumbers.push(numbers[i] * 10);
}

newNumbers; // [0,10,20,30,40]

numbers.map((eachNum) => {
	return eachNum * 10;
});
(5) [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]

- since this is single return stmt:
numbers.map((eachNum) => eachNum * 10);
  - OR -
numbers.map(eachNum => eachNum * 10);

- for our pic app we are doing this:
const numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3];
numbers.map(num => <div>{num}</div>)

*** our pics app ex) ***
const ImageList = props => {
  return <div>ImageList</div>;
};


*** what response obj gives you
response > data > results > urls > 

*** each Child should have unique "key" prop Warning message how to fix and what is that mean?

index.js:1375 Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.

Check the render method of `ImageList`. See https://fb.me/react-warning-keys for more information.
    in img (at ImageList.js:6)
    in ImageList (at App.js:28)
    in div (at App.js:22)
    in App (at src/index.js:6)

- It is best to keep the key=value when rendering element in the DOM using React.
  * when we get element from api calls > we usu get id element

  * We need to assign the key={image.id} to the root elment that we are returning from a list of records.

  const images = props.images.map(image => {
    return ( // here div is the root element
      <div key={image.id}>
        <img src={image.urls.regular}>
      </div>
    )
  });

  * option 2 to add key ID)

  const images = props.images.map(image => {
    // here image is response.data.results which is an array
    return <img key={image.id} src={image.urls.regular} />
  });

  - make it accessible:
  import React from 'react';

const ImageList = (props) => {
  const images = props.images.map((image) => {
    // note: image = response.data.result
    return <img 
    key={image.id} 
    src={image.urls.regular} 
    alt={image.description} />
  });

  return <div>{images}</div>;
};

export default ImageList;

- image are being repeated 3 times. let's use destructuring. destructuring destructure example es6

before:
  const images = props.images.map((image) => {
    return 
    <img 
    key={image.id} 
    src={image.urls.regular} 
    alt={image.description} 
    />
  });

after: // 1. remove image and insert {} with property
  const images = props.images.map(({ 
    id, 
    urls, 
    description 
  }) => { // 2. delete anywhere you see `image.`
    return 
    <img 
    key={id}  // used to be key={image.id} 
    src={urls.regular} // used to be src={image.urls.regular} 
    alt={description} // used to be alt={image.description}
    />
  });

  - how to import imagList.css to react
  import './ImageList.css';

  * to have images to show up 4 in the row:
Grid (https://alligator.io/css/css-grid-layout-fr-unit/)

* Inside of ImageList.css) 
 .image-list {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));
}

.image-list img {
  width: 250px;
}

* ImageList.js)
import './ImageList.css';
import React from 'react';


const ImageList = (props) => {
  const images = props.images.map(({ id, urls, description }) => {
    // note: image = response.data.result
    return <img key={id} src={urls.regular} alt={description} />
  });

  return <div className="image-list">{images}</div>;
};

export default ImageList;

- grid system css: grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));

.image-list {
  display: grid;
  /* 1fr (max allocation of space) where all col is equal width, minMax (250px, 1fr) each column at minimum 250px wide, 1fr max allocation of space  */
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  grid-gap: 10px;
}

- row tallness for grid
.image-list {
  display: grid;
  /* 1fr (max allocation of space) where all col is equal width, minMax (250px, 1fr) each column at minimum 250px wide, 1fr max allocation of space  */
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  grid-gap: 10px;
  /* how tall each cell grid-auto-rows */
  grid-auto-rows: 150px;
}

.image-list img {
  width: 250px;
}

- grid-auto-rows tallness of the cell

- grid-row-end: span 3 (image given 3 cells to display in a rows of tree: 3 cells down)

  ex) .image-list img { // every image will span down 3 
  width: 250px;
  grid-row-end: span 3;
}

- example of destructuring (gist demo: https://github.gapinc.com/gist/hcastan/31cfcc81946efacea2f2bf85004f15cf)
//  Note we are referring to this.props.image over and over
//   this is great opportunity to destructure.

// any properties you were going to name in the obj put it inside of left side.  here we are assigning .image obj with properties description and .image obj with properties urls

 class ImageCard extends React.Component {
  render () {
    const { description, urls } = this.props.image;

    return (
      <div>
        <img 
          alt={this.props.image.description}

// ES6 supports destructuring: you can create a variable with the same name as an equivalent object property. For example:  https://www.sitepoint.com/es6-enhanced-object-literals/
var { text, iconName } = seasonConfig["summer"];
// => text => "Lets hit the beach", iconName => "sun"
text
iconName

//=================================================================================================
// ES5 explicit extract a property value from an obj into another variable

var seasonConfig = {
  summer: {
    text: 'Lets hit the beach',
    iconName: 'sun'
  },
  winter: {
    text: 'Burr it is cold!',
    iconName: 'snowflake'
  }
}

var text = seasonConfig.summer.text; // 'Lets hit the beach'
// or
var text = seasonConfig["summer"]["text"]; // 'Lets hit the beach'

const ImageList = (props) => {

    alt={image.description} />
  });

  return <div>{images}</div>;

export default ImageList;

- image are being repeated 3 times. let's use destructuring. destructuring destructure example es6

before:
  const images = props.images.map((image) => {
    return 
    <img 
    key={image.id} 
    src={image.urls.regular} 
    alt={image.description} 
    />
  });

after: // 1. remove image and insert {} with property
  const images = props.images.map(({ 
    id, 
    urls, 
    description 
  }) => { // 2. delete anywhere you see `image.`
    return 
    <img 
    key={id}  // used to be key={image.id} 
    src={urls.regular} // used to be src={image.urls.regular} 
    alt={description} // used to be alt={image.description}
    />
  });
    
 ++++++++++++++++++++++++
//  Note we are ref
 class ImageCard extends React.Component {
  render () {
    const { description, urls } = this.props.image;

    return (
      <div>
        <img 
          alt={this.props.image.description}
          src={this.props.image.urls.regular}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

- example of destructuring
//  Note we are referring to this.props.image over and over
//   this is great opportunity to destructure.

// any properties you were going to name in the obj put it inside of left side.  here we are assigning .image obj with properties description and .image obj with properties urls

 class ImageCard extends React.Component {
  render () {
    const { description, urls } = this.props.image;

    return (
      <div>
        <img 
          alt={this.props.image.description}
          src={this.props.image.urls.regular}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const this.props = {
  image: {
    description: 'cat looking up',
    urls : {
      regular: 'https://google.com/cat',
    }
  }
}

------------
** Next iteration:
1) Let the ImageCard render itself and its image.
2) Reach into the DOM and figure out the height of the image
3) Set the image height on state to get the component to rerender
4) When rerendering, assign a 'grid-row-end' to make sure the image takes up the appropriate space.


- vanilla JS to get height of image of render img
> document.querySelectorAll('img')[0].height // 321 px
or
> document.querySelector('img').clientHeight

- when you want to get access to DOM using React we use: ref system!

* React Refs - a system 
1) gives access to a single DOM Element.
2) We create refs in the constructor, assign them to instance variables, then pass to a particular JSX elements as props

Here is ex how we react to have access to the DOM like JSX element
1) set constructor with super props
  class ImageCard extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);

      this.imageRef = React.createRef();
    }

2) reference inside of render method return <img> JSX element which gives you some properties of the img jsx using ref

  render () {
    const { description, urls } = this.props.image;

    return (
      <div>
        <img
          ref={this.imageRef} // ref to DOM like JSX element
          alt={description}
          src={urls.regular}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
- example of Image Card to view what imageRef gives you
import React from 'react';
import ImageList from './ImageList';

class ImageCard extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.imageRef = React.createRef();
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log(this.imageRef);
    console.log('ref height', this.imageRef.current.height)
    ;  // => `ref height 212`
  }

  render () {
    const { description, urls } = this.props.image;

    return (
      <div>
        <img
          // react's reference to DOM
          ref={this.imageRef}
          alt={description}
          src={urls.regular}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ImageCard;

- how to make sure your image is loaded on react Dom

class ImageCard extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.imageRef = React.createRef();
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    this.imageRef.current.addEventListener('load', this.setSpans);
  }

<!-- grid-row-end: span 3; we are trying to update this -->
componentDidMount() {
    // console.log(this.imageRef);
    // console.log('ref height', this.imageRef.current.height);
    // console.log('ref clientHeight', this.imageRef.current.clientHeight);
    
    // makes sure image height has the chance to load to web browser and this.setSpans callback function invoked
    this.imageRef.current.addEventListener('load', this.setSpans);
  }

  setSpans = () => {
    // get the correct height of this image
    console.log(this.imageRef.current.clientHeight);
  }
- understanding spans calculation Math.height
  setSpans = () => {
    // get the correct height of this image
    // console.log(this.imageRef.current.clientHeight);
    const height = this.imageRef.current.clientHeight;
    // Math.ceil: cap its value, 150px is row height, adding 1 for any decimal leftover value to get the full number  ex) if you have 320height Imag/ 150 row height
    // => 2.13 + 1 = 3.13 and do a ceil will bring the span to next level up.  Math.ceil(3.13) => 4 rounding up
    const spans = Math.ceil(height / 150);

*** Class-Based Components:
- State, Lifecycle Methods (Component Did Update, COmponent did mount, Componenet will unmount)
  setState method

* ex Class-Based Componenet)
class ImageCard extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = { spans: 0 };
    this.imageRef = React.createRef();
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    // console.log(this.imageRef);
    // console.log('ref height', this.imageRef.current.height);
    // console.log('ref clientHeight', this.imageRef.current.clientHeight);

    // makes sure image height has the chance to load to web browser and this.setSpans callback function invoked

  }

  setSpans = () => {
    // get the correct height of this image
    // console.log(this.imageRef.current.clientHeight);
    const height = this.imageRef.current.clientHeight;
    // Math.ceil: cap its value, 150px is row height, adding 1 for any decimal leftover value to get the full number  ex) if you have 320height Imag/ 150 row height
    // => 2.13 + 1 = 3.13 and do a ceil will bring the span to next level up.  Math.ceil(3.13) => 4 rounding up
    const spans = Math.ceil(height / 10);

    // this.setState({ spans: spans });
    this.setState({ spans });
  };

  render () {
    const { description, urls } = this.props.image;

    return (
      <div style={{ gridRowEnd: `span ${this.state.spans}` }}>
        <img
          // react's reference to DOM
          ref={this.imageRef}
          alt={description}
          src={urls.regular}
        />
      </div>
    );

*** Function-Based Components:
- Not Much!  functions that returns JSX

* ex Function-Based Component)
  import './ImageList.css';
  import React from 'react';
  import ImageCard from './ImageCard';


const ImageList = (props) => {
  const images = props.images.map((image) => {
    // note: image = response.data.result
    return <ImageCard key={image.id} image={image} />
  });

  return <div className="image-list">{images}</div>;
};

export default ImageList;

- hook system: borrowing some of class-based components add-on to Function-Based Components
  - Function-Based Componenets:
  (Hooks> State, Lifecycle Methods)

What is great about it that we can add state and lifecycle Methods to function-based components??
  * Hook Makes it easy to share logic between components.
![hook](https://cdn.glitch.com/cb093bfd-142f-45b3-bdb4-52ff49e0a1c2%2FreasonHookgood.png?v=1560966797679)

- Hooks will allow code reuse

- allow function based components to have component level States and lifecycle methods.
  * Goal of hook system: add in reusable logic to our app
  Show a very simple example of hooks and make sure you understand how to use hooks by themselves.

Grab Usage
> Usage
To use the Primer theme:
Add the following to your site's _config.yml:
theme: jekyll-theme-primer

Grab the theme name: "jekyll-theme-primer"

1. > go to Gemfile > add 
# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.
gem "minima", "~> 2.0"
gem "jekyll-theme-primer"

2. _in terminal add)
> bundle install // telling jekyll to install gems

_inside of _config.yml) update the theme (https://youtu.be/NoRS2D-cyko?t=260)
# Build settings
markdown: kramdown
theme: jekyll-theme-primer <<< I am updating the gem name here!
plugins:
  - jekyll-feed

Next, Run
> bundle exec jekyll serve // use new theme

_Now we could serve it once you have the theme updated in _config.yml file)
1. > bundle install
2. add theme inside of _config.yml)
3. > bundle exec jekyll serve // use new theme
  => this should run the newest theme

but you will notice nothing is showing on your page with warning on your terminal saying no page, home not exist
> notice under _layouts for your theme github
they only have 1) default.html, 2) post.html
(https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker/tree/master/_layouts)
therefore, only use default
TODO: update the front matter tags on your site to default _layout

---
# Feel free to add content and custom Front Matter to this file.
# To modify the layout, see https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults

layout: default

Try to keep the layouts to use single layout so it is easy to switch it out when adopting a new theme.

- how to create data files
3 types of data files: 1) .yml 2) .jason 3) .csv

json, csv great for database
1) create _data folder inside root dir
2) create people.yml
- name: "Mike"
  occupation: "GA teacher"

- name: "Heggy"
  occupation: "GA student"

- name: "Sally"
  occupation: "GA watcher"
3) inside _layout > home.html)

// here we are loop thru
{% for person in site.data.people %}
  {{ person.name }}, {{ person.occupation }} <br>
{% endfor %}

- Static Site Generator: 
anything with no front matter ( static site such as js file, css, html
1. inside root dir > asset folder) save few pdf, png files
2. home.html
// how to show where asset files are: site path
{% for file in site.static_files %}
  {{ file.path }}
{% endfor %}

Note: any static file it will be found by file.path using site.static_files!!!
  You don't have to save static files under /assets/ folder only.

- home.html different info you could loop thru

{% for person in site.data.people %}
  {{ person.name }}, {{ person.occupation }} <br>
{% endfor %}

<hr>

{% for file in site.static_files %}
  path: {{ file.path }} <br>
  name: {{ file.name }} <br>
  basename: {{ file.basename }} <br>
  ext: {{ file.extname }} <br>
{% endfor %}

- Adding front matters to img files 
1) root dir > create assets/img/
move photos

2) config.yml 
create defaults variable for your img file
// make new entry
  set scope:
    path: "assets/img" // this is where we will set the front matter variable to
    // here we will give certain piece of front matter.
  set values: // here we set all the front matter values
    image: true // all the front matter image will set the image value true.
Done!  Now we need to restart the server
---- ex)
# Build settings
markdown: kramdown
theme: minima
plugins:
  - jekyll-feed

defaults:
  - scope: 
      path: "assets/img"
    values: 
      image: true

-----

- make it show the image on home page:
inside _layouts/home.html)

{% for file in site.static_files %}

  {% if file.image %}
    <img src="{{file.path}}" alt="{file.name}">

What does ‘pwd’ stand for and what makes it useful?
> ‘Print Working Directory’ pwd

> cd jan/memory/ pwd
> cd ../feb // jump up a level and to feb folder

> mkdir media // create a new folder name media
mkdir command stands for “make directory”. 

- touch command creates new file inside of working dir

> ls -t // order files and dir by the time they were modified.
In addition to -a, the ls command has several more options. Here are three common options:
  -a - lists all contents, including hidden files and directories
  -l - lists all contents of a directory in long format
  -t - order files and directories by the time they were last modified.

ls -l
$ ls -l
drwxr-xr-x 5  cc  eng  4096 Jun 24 16:51  action
drwxr-xr-x 4  cc  eng  4096 Jun 24 16:51  comedy
drwxr-xr-x 6  cc  eng  4096 Jun 24 16:51  drama
-rw-r--r-- 1  cc  eng     0 Jun 24 16:51  genres.txt
The -l option lists files and directories as a table. Here there are four rows, with seven columns separated by spaces. Here’s what each column means:

Access rights. These are actions that are permitted on a file or directory.
Number of hard links. This number counts the number of child directories and files. This number includes the parent directory link (..) and current directory link (.).
The username of the file’s owner. Here the username is cc.
The name of the group that owns the file. Here the group name is eng.
The size of the file in bytes.
The date & time that the file was last modified.
The name of the file or directory.

- multiple options used together:
> ls -alt // lists in hidden, list, order by time were modified
Here, ls -alt lists all contents, including hidden files and directories, in long format, ordered by the date and time they were last modified.

> cp frida.txt
> cp biopic/cleo.txt historical/  // copy from bio/cleo to historical/ folder
> cp <source> <destination>
Here, we copy the file biopic/cleopatra.txt and place it in the historical/ directory.
> cp biopic/ray.txt biopic/notorious.txt historical/

> cp * satire/ // omitting directories 'satire', 'slapstick' copies all other files
only copies current directory files

> ../../action/ // jump twice and go into action folder

> cp m*.txt scifi/ // anything starting m* move to scifi folder

- wildcard:
The * selects all files in the working directory, so here we use cp to copy all files into the satire/ directory.
> cp m*.txt scifi/

- Here, m*.txt selects all files in the working directory starting with “m” and ending with “.txt”, and copies them to scifi/.

3 ways to 
> mv superman.txt superhero/  // move source destination

> mv wonderwoman.txt batman.txt superhero/ //wonderwoman.txt and batman.txt both move into superhero/
mv wonderwoman.txt batman.txt superhero/
To move multiple files into a directory, use mv with a list of source files as the first arguments, and the destination directory as the last argument. Here, we move wonderwoman.txt and batman.txt into superhero/.

> mv batman.txt spiderman.txt // renamess 

> rm -r comedy
The -r is an option that modifies the behavior of the rm command. The -r stands for “recursive,” and it’s used to delete a directory and all of its child directories

Options modify the behavior of commands:
ls -a lists all contents of a directory, including hidden files and directories
ls -l lists all contents in long format
ls -t orders files and directories by the time they were last modified
Multiple options can be used together, like ls -alt
From the command line, you can also copy, move, and remove files and directories:
cp copies files
mv moves and renames files
rm removes files
rm -r removes directories
Wildcards are useful for selecting groups of files and directories

- Defintion:

* standard input, abbreviated as stdin, is information inputted into the terminal through the keyboard or input device.
* standard output, abbreviated as stdout, is the information outputted after a process is run.
* standard error, abbreviated as stderr, is an error message outputted by a failed process.

> cat oceans.txt > continents.txt
`>` replaces takes the standard output of the command on the left, and redirects it to the file on the right. Here the standard output of cat oceans.txt is redirected to continents.txt.

Note that > overwrites all original content in continents.txt. When you view the output data by typing cat on continents.txt, you will see only the contents of oceans.txt.

cat to view continent.txt
cat 

> cat glaciers.txt >> rivers.txt
`>>` takes the standard output of the command on the left and appends (adds) it to the file on the right. You can view the output data of the file with cat and the filename.

> cat < lakes.txt
`<` takes the standard input from the file on the right and inputs it into the program on the left. Here, lakes.txt is the standard input for the cat command. The standard output appears in the terminal.

> `|` is a “pipe”. The `|` takes the standard output of the command on the left, and pipes it as standard input to the command on the right. You can think of this as “command to command” redirection.

> grep shelll dic.txt | less
https://youtu.be/AWpVScp9z4s?t=65
// grep: "global regular expression print,” processes text line by line and prints any lines which match a specified pattern.  Lines with particular content. Then it gets send to the `less` program which display result one page at a time.
// wc: word count

> `grep shell dictionary.txt | less` 
// Look for any word with

? How many words are there in dictionary.txt that match the pattern ibo?

> uniq deserts.txt # unique deserts only
> sort deserts.txt | uniq # sort and uniq deserts.txt
> sort deserts.txt | uniq > uniq-deserts.txt # sort > unique deserts piping into store function inside uniq-deserts.txt file

- Redirection:
  1. `|` [pipes][pipes] things to another program or place
  _(`grep`: "global regular expression print,” processes text line by line and prints any lines which match a specified pattern.  Lines with particular content. Then it gets send to the `less` program which display result one page at a time.)_

    `grep shell dic.txt | less`
  _(# look for any line that has "shell" > pipe it > less program)_

  * Question: What is the distinction of the uses of output redirection, >, and piping, |? 
  
    `|` for input vs `>` for store

    ex)

    `x | y` # take the output of x and use it as the input for y

    `x > y` # save, i.e. store, the output of x into the location defined by y

q) We are introduced to the sort function here 5. Can we use sort for sorting input not separated by newlines?

Answer)
Though the function sort only works to sort input separated by newlines, just as we have been able to chain together simple command line functions to accomplish complex tasks, we can do the same to sort input not separated by newlines. In order to do this, we will need to replace the symbols separating the input we would like to sort by newlines. To accomplish this, we can use the sed command (which we also learn about in this section). For instance, if our input, in.txt, is separated by spaces instead of newlines, we can sort the file by

```
sed -e "s/ /\n/g" in.txt | sort
```

> grep -i Mount mountains.txt # case insensitive `-i`
grep -i enables the command to be case insensitive. Here, grep searches for capital or lowercase strings that match Mount in mountains.txt.  grep stands for “global regular expression print”.  The above commands are a great way to get started with grep. If you are familiar with regular expressions, you can use regular expressions to search for patterns in files.


> sed 's/snow/rain/' forests.txt 
sed stands for “stream editor”. It accepts standard input and modifies it based on an expression, before displaying it as output data. It is similar to “find and replace”.

Let’s look at the expression 's/snow/rain/':

s: stands for “substitution”. it is always used when using sed for substitution.
snow: the search string, the text to find.
rain: the replacement string, the text to add in place.
In this case, sed searches forests.txt for the word “snow” and replaces it with “rain.” Importantly, the above command will only replace the first instance of “snow” on a line.


  ex) `$ sed 's/snow/rain/g' forests.txt `

  _#g expression, meaning “global”. Here sed searches forests.txt for the word “snow” and replaces it with “rain”, globally. All instances of “snow” on a line will be turned to “rain”._

Redirection reroutes standard input, standard output, and standard error.

The common redirection commands are:

> redirects standard output of a command to a file, overwriting previous content.
>> redirects standard output of a command to a file, appending new content to old content.
< redirects standard input to a command.
| redirects standard output of a command to another command.
A number of other commands are powerful when combined with redirection commands:

sort: sorts lines of text alphabetically.
uniq: filters duplicate, adjacent lines of text.
grep: searches for a text pattern and outputs it.
sed : searches for a text pattern, modifies it, and outputs it.

#### command line text editor:
Command line text editor called nano.

In the terminal, type
nano hello.txt 

"Hello, I am nano." 
** nano commands:
> `Ctrl + O` (the letter, not the number) to save the file. This is the letter “O”, not the number zero.
> `Ctrl + X` to exit nano.
> `clear` to clear the terminal window
The menu of keyboard commands at the bottom of the window allow us to save changes to hello.txt and exit nano. The ^ stands for the Ctrl key.
Ctrl + O saves a file. ‘O’ stands for output.
Ctrl + X exits the nano program. ‘X’ stands for exit.
Ctrl + G opens a help menu.
clear clears the terminal window, moving the command prompt to the top of the screen.

> nano ~/.bash_profile // from current folder 
The ~ represents the user’s home directory.
The . indicates a hidden file.
The name ~/.bash_profile is important, since this is how the command line recognizes the bash profile.

$ nano ~/.bash_profile
~/.bash_profile is the name of file used to store environment settings. It is commonly called the “bash profile”. When a session starts, it will load the contents of the bash profile before executing commands.
- The text echo "Welcome, Jane Doe" creates a greeting in the bash profile, which is saved. It tells the command line to echo the string “Welcome, Jane Doe” when a terminal session begins.

The command `source ~/.bash_profile` activates the changes in ~/.bash_profile for the current session. Instead of closing the terminal and needing to start a new session, source makes the changes available right away in the session we are in.

Open ~/.bash_profile in nano.
> nano ~/.bash_profile

Ctrl + O saves a file
> `Ctrl + O` (the letter, not the number) to save the file. This is the letter “O”, not the number zero.
> `Ctrl + X` to exit nano.

In ~/.bash_profile, beneath the greeting you created, type

alias pd="pwd"
Save the file. > `Ctrl + O`

Press Enter to write the filename
Exit nano. > `Ctrl + X`

In the command line, use the source command to activate the changes in the current session.
> source ~/.bash_profile # activate the changes in the current session
> alias pd="pwd" # enter this inside of .bash_profile
- Source to activate the changes to the bash profile for the current session.
  > source ~/.bash_profile

alias hy="history"
alias ll="ls -la"

hy is set as alias for the history command in the bash profile. The alias is then made available in the current session through source. By typing hy, the command line outputs a history of commands that were entered in the current session.

By typing ll, the command line now outputs all contents and directories in long format, including all hidden files.

- environment variables.

Open ~/.bash_profile in nano.
add
>export USER="Jane Doe" 

In terminal)
> echo $USER
This should return the value of the variable that you set.

`PS1` is a variable that defines the makeup and style of the command prompt.

export PS1=">> " sets the command prompt variable and exports the variable. Here we change the default command prompt from $ to >>.
After using the source command, the command line displays the new command prompt.

> echo $HOME 
This returns the value of the HOME variable.
$ echo $HOME 
The HOME variable is an environment variable that displays the path of the home directory. Here by typing echo $HOME, the terminal displays the path /home/ccuser as output.

You can customize the HOME variable if needed, but in most cases this is not necessary.

PATH
What happens when you type this command?

$ echo $PATH

/home/ccuser/.gem/ruby/2.0.0/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/bin
PATH is an environment variable that stores a list of directories separated by a colon. Looking carefully, echo $PATH lists the following directories:

/home/ccuser/.gem/ruby/2.0.0/bin
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
/bin
Each directory contains scripts for the command line to execute. The PATH variable simply lists which directories contain scripts.

For example, many commands we’ve learned are scripts stored in the /bin directory.

> env | grep PATH 
env | grep PATH is a command that displays the value of a single environment variable. Here the standard output of env is “piped” to the grep command. grep searches for the value of the variable PATH and outputs it to the terminal.

- The environment refers to the preferences and settings of the current user.

The nano editor is a command line text editor used to configure the environment.

~/.bash_profile is where environment settings are stored. You can edit this file with nano.

environment variables are variables that can be used across commands and programs and hold information about the environment.

export VARIABLE="Value" sets and exports an environment variable.
USER is the name of the current user.
PS1 is the command prompt.
HOME is the home directory. It is usually not customized.
PATH returns a colon separated list of file paths. It is customized in advanced cases.
env returns a list of environment variables.

Bash (or shell) scripting is a great way to automate repetitive tasks and can save you a ton of time as a developer. Bash scripts execute within a Bash shell interpreter terminal. Any command you can run in your terminal can be run in a Bash script. When you have a command or set of commands that you will be using frequently, consider writing a Bash script to perform it.

There are some conventions to follow to ensure that your computer is able to find and execute your Bash scripts. The beginning of your script file should start with #!/bin/bash on its own line. This tells the computer which type of interpreter to use for the script. When saving the script file, it is good practice to place commonly used scripts in the ~/bin/ directory.

The script files also need to have the “execute” permission to allow them to be run. To add this permission to a file with filename: script.sh use:

chmod +x script.sh
Your terminal runs a file every time it is opened to load its configuration. On Linux style shells, this is ~/.bashrc and on OSX, this is ~/.bash_profile. To ensure that scripts in ~/bin/ are available, you must add this directory to your PATH within your configuration file:

PATH=~/bin:$PATH
Now any scripts in the ~/bin directory can be run from anywhere by typing the filename.

inside of script.sh)
Add a line to the beginning of script.sh to specify that it should be run using bash
#!/bin/bash


- Run script unix in the terminal.
  > ./script.sh to run the script.

Within bash scripts (or the terminal for that matter), variables are declared by setting the variable name equal to another value. For example, to set the variable greeting to “Hello”, you would use the following syntax:

greeting="Hello"

- Variables: phrase="Hello to you!"
Within bash scripts (or the terminal for that matter), variables are declared by setting the variable name equal to another value. For example, to set the variable greeting to “Hello”, you would use the following syntax:

> greeting="Hello"
Note that there is no space between the variable name, the equals sign, or “Hello”.

To access the value of a variable, we use the variable name prepended with a dollar sign ($). In the previous example, if we want to print the variable value to the screen, we use the following syntax:

> echo $greeting

Create a variable phrase on the line before the current echo statement. Set the phrase equal to the string “Hello to you!”.
#!/bin/bash
phrase="Hello to you!"
echo "Hello Codecademy!"

Remember to prepend a $ to access its value.
Run the script in the terminal.
> ./script.sh

A complete conditional in a bash script uses the following syntax:

```
if [ $index -lt 5 ]
then
  echo $index
else
  echo 5
fi
```

Here is the list of comparison operators for numbers you can use within bash scripts:

Equal: -eq
Not equal: -ne
Less than or equal: -le
Less than: -lt
Greater than or equal: -ge
Greater than: -gt
Is null: -z

When comparing strings, it is best practice to put the variable into quotes ("). This prevents errors if the variable is null or contains spaces. The common operators for comparing strings are:

Equal: ==
Not equal: !=
For example, to compare if the variables foo and bar contain the same string:

if [ "$foo" == "$bar"]

We’ve added two different greetings and a variable to store how many times the user has been greeted before. If this variable is less than 1, we want to use first_greeting. Otherwise, we want to use later_greeting.

Add a line setting up the if conditional. Use the -lt operator.

#!/bin/bash
first_greeting="Nice to meet you!"
later_greeting="How are you?"
greeting_occasion=1

if [$greeting_occasion -lt 1]
then
	echo $first_greeting
else
	echo $later_greeting
fi

Run the script: ./script.sh

Loops
There are 3 different ways to loop within a bash script: for, while and until.

A for loop is used to iterate through a list and execute an action at each step. For example, if we had a list of words stored in a variable paragraph, we could use the following syntax to print each one:

for word in $paragraph
do
  echo $word
done
Note that word is being “defined” at the top of the for loop so there is no $ prepended. Remember that we prepend the $ when accessing the value of the variable. So, when accessing the variable within the do block, we use $word as usual.

Within bash scripting until and while are very similar. while loops keep looping while the provided condition is true whereas until loops loop until the condition is true. Conditions are established the same way as they are within an if block, between square brackets. If we want to print the index variable as long as it is less than 5, we would use the following while loop:

while [ $index -lt 5 ]
do
  echo $index
  index=$((index + 1))
done
Note that arithmetic in bash scripting uses the $((...)) syntax and within the brackets the variable name is not prepended with a $.

The same loop could also be written as an until loop as follows:

until [ $index -eq 5 ]
do
  echo $index
  index=$((index + 1))
done

- arithmetic in bash scripting uses the $((...))
> greeting_occasion=$((greeting_occasion + 1))
```
#!/bin/bash
first_greeting="Nice to meet you!"
later_greeting="How are you?"
greeting_occasion=0
while [ $greeting_occasion -lt 3 ]
do 
  if [ $greeting_occasion -lt 1 ]
  then
    echo $first_greeting
  else
    echo $later_greeting
  fi
  greeting_occasion=$((greeting_occasion + 1))
done
```
[9:52 AM] Johnee Evanofski
try this and see how far you can get:
1. checkout your twocol branch 
2. git rebase master 
3. there will be conflicts you can see by doing git status 
4. look at each file and fix the conflicts, keep the changes that you want on your new branch (this may break your jekyll serve) 
5. once you've made your changes 
6. git rebase --continue 
7. git status 
8. once all conflicts are resolved you're good to go 
9. you may need to force push the branch back up git push -f 
Edited

[9:56 AM] Johnee Evanofski
if you mess up all of your stuff while you're still in rebase you can start over with git rebase --abort

[9:57 AM] Johnee Evanofski
if the rebase finishes and it doesn't look how you want it to just force pull down from github and overwrite your changes


LEARN BASH SCRIPTING
Inputs
To make bash scripts more useful, we need to be able to access data external to the bash script file itself. The first way to do this is by prompting the user for input. For this, we use the read syntax. To ask the user for input and save it to the number variable, we would use the following code:

echo "Guess a number"
read number
echo "You guessed $number"
Another way to access external data is to have the user add input arguments when they run your script. These arguments are entered after the script name and are separated by spaces. For example:

saycolors red green blue
Within the script, these are accessed using $1, $2, etc, where $1 is the first argument (here, “red”) and so on. Note that these are 1 indexed.

If your script needs to accept an indefinite number of input arguments, you can iterate over them using the "$@" syntax. For our saycolors example, we could print each color using:

for color in "$@"
do
  echo $color
done
Lastly, we can access external files to our script. You can assign a set of files to a variable name using standard bash pattern matching using regular expressions. For example, to get all files in a directory, you can use the * character:

files=/some/directory/*
You can then iterate through each file and do something. Here, lets just print the full path and filename:

for file in $files
do
  echo $file
done

## Scenario:
I am on `twocol` branch on github.  There is a merge conflict when trying to merge from `twocol` branch to `gh-pages` branch.  What are the steps to resolve my conflicts?

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/branches.png" alt="github 3 branches" width="350px">

## Take away:
 
- Checkout twocol branch `git checkout twocol`
- `git rebase gh-pages`

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/rebase-gh-pg.png" alt="rebase gh-pg" width="500px">

- `git status` _(view conflicts)_

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/modified.png" alt="conflict messages" width="500px">

- Open code editor and look at the files that says **`both modified`**.  Most of the times `Accept incoming changes` is the right answer _(since incoming change *is* the new code you want to keep)_.  Otherwise, fix the conflicts by selecting one of the choices you see on the screen.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/incoming-change.png" alt="incoming current incoming selections" width="500px">

- Once you've made your changes for all **`both modified`** files; `save` your changes.  In your terminal, `git add .` > `git rebase --continue` > `git status` _(If there are more conflicts; repeat previous steps to fix all the conflicts)_
- `git rebase --continue`
- `git status`
- Once all conflicts are resolved; you may see `nothing to commit`.  You are done resolving your conflicts!

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/conflict-non.png" alt="no more conflict" width="500px">

- Force push the branch back up `git push -f`
- **DONE**

## Help:
- If you mess up and **while you're still in `rebase`**; you can start over with `git rebase --abort`
- If the rebase finishes and your code doesn't look how you want it then just force pull down from github and overwrite your changes.

files=/some/directory/*
You can then iterate through each file and do something. Here, lets just print the full path and filename:

for file in $files
do
  echo $file
done

#!/bin/bash
first_greeting="Nice to meet you!"
later_greeting="How are you?"
greeting_occasion=0
echo "enter greeting_limit"
read greeting_limit
echo "You input $greeting_limit"
while [ $greeting_occasion -lt $greeting_limit ]
do
  if [ $greeting_occasion -lt 1 ]
  then
    echo $first_greeting
  else
    echo $later_greeting
  fi
  greeting_occasion=$((greeting_occasion + 1))
done


Q I didn't get right) Get user input and assign it to the variable greeting_limit. Replace the limit of 3 in the while loop with $greeting_limit.

#!/bin/bash
first_greeting="Nice to meet you!"
later_greeting="How are you?"
greeting_occasion=0
echo "How many times should I greet?"
read greeting_limit
while [ $greeting_occasion -lt $greeting_limit ]
do
  if [ $greeting_occasion -lt 1 ]
  then
    echo $first_greeting
  else
    echo $later_greeting
  fi
  greeting_occasion=$((greeting_occasion + 1))
done

for word in $paragraph
do
  echo $word
done
Note that word is being “defined” at the top of the for loop so there is no $ prepended. Remember that we prepend the $ when accessing the value of the variable. So, when accessing the variable within the do block, we use $word as usual. 

- input:
To make bash scripts more useful, we need to be able to access data external to the bash script file itself. The first way to do this is by prompting the user for input. For this, we use the read syntax. To ask the user for input and save it to the number variable, we would use the following code:

echo "Guess a number"
read number
echo "You guessed $number"

- Aliases
You can set up aliases for your bash scripts within your .bashrc or .bash_profile file to allow calling your scripts without the full filename. For example, if we have our saycolors.sh script, we can alias it to the word saycolors using the following syntax:

alias saycolors='./saycolors.sh'
You can even add standard input arguments to your alias. For example, if we always want “green” to be included as the first input to saycolors, we could modify our alias to:

alias saycolors='./saycolors.sh "green"`

Our script is updated to take an argument for the number of times the user wants to be greeted:

./script.sh 5 #greets 5 times
Let’s create an alias so that when you type greet3 in the terminal, our script greets you three times.

In your own environment, you could add this alias to your ~/.bashrc to make the alias active every time the terminal is started.

- Aliases:
Create an alias `greet3` that calls ./script.sh with argument 3.

In your own environment, you could add this alias to your `~/.bashrc` to make the alias active every time the terminal is started.

```
alias greet3="./script.sh 3" #greets 3 times
```

Take a minute to review what you’ve learned about bash scripting.

Any command that can be run in the terminal can be run in a bash script.
Variables are assigned using an equals sign with no space (greeting="hello").
Variables are accessed using a dollar sign (echo $greeting).
Conditionals use if, then, else, fi syntax.
Three types of loops can be used: for, while, and until.
Bash scripts use a unique set of comparison operators:
Equal: -eq
Not equal: -ne
Less than or equal: -le
Less than: -lt
Greater than or equal: -ge
Greater than: -gt
Is null: -z
Input arguments can be passed to a bash script after the script name, separated by spaces (myScript.sh “hello” “how are you”).
Input can be requested from the script user with the read keyword.
Aliases can be created in the .bashrc or .bash_profile using the alias keyword.

when does branch get ahead?
  > git checkout <branchName>
  > git checkout newImage; git commit
 

Ok! You are all ready to get branching. Once this window closes, make a new branch named bugFix and switch to that branch.

By the way, here's a shortcut: if you want to create a new branch AND check it out at the same time, you can simply type 
  > git checkout -b [yourbranchname]
  > git checkout -b bugfix

Branches and Merging
Great! We now know how to commit and branch. Now we need to learn some kind of way of combining the work from two different branches together. This will allow us to branch off, develop a new feature, and then combine it back in.

The first method to combine work that we will examine is git merge. Merging in Git creates a special commit that has two unique parents. A commit with two parents essentially means "I want to include all the work from this parent over here and this one over here, and the set of all their parents."

It's easier with visuals, let's check it out in the next view

Here we have two branches; each has one commit that's unique. This means that neither branch includes the entire set of "work" in the repository that we have done. Let's fix that with merge.

We will merge the branch bugFix into master
> git merge bugFix

Woah! See that? First of all, master now points to a commit that has two parents. If you follow the arrows up the commit tree from master, you will hit every commit along the way to the root. This means that master contains all the work in the repository now.

Also, see how the colors of the commits changed? To help with learning, I have included some color coordination. Each branch has a unique color. Each commit turns a color that is the blended combination of all the branches that contain that commit.

So here we see that the master branch color is blended into all the commits, but the bugFix color is not. Let's fix that...

Let's merge master into bugFix:

> git checkout bugFix; git merge master

Since bugFix was an ancestor of master, git didn't have to do any work; it simply just moved bugFix to the same commit master was attached to.

Now all the commits are the same color, which means each branch contains all the work in the repository! Woohoo!

To complete this level, do the following steps:

Make a new branch called `bugFix`
Checkout the `bugFix` branch with `git checkout bugFix`
> git checkout -b bugFix
Commit once 
> git commit -m "Hello"
Go back to `master` with `git checkout`
> git checkout master
Commit another time
> git commit -m "I am already on master"
Merge the branch `bugFix` into `master` with `git merge`
> git merge bugFix
Remember, you can always re-display this dialog with "objective"!

## Git Rebase
The second way of combining work between branches is rebasing. Rebasing essentially takes a set of commits, "copies" them, and plops them down somewhere else.

While this sounds confusing, the advantage of rebasing is that it can be used to make a nice linear sequence of commits. The commit log / history of the repository will be a lot cleaner if only rebasing is allowed.

Let's see it in action...

Here we have two branches yet again; note that the bugFix branch is currently selected (note the asterisk)

We would like to move our work from bugFix directly onto the work from master. That way it would look like these two features were developed sequentially, when in reality they were developed in parallel.

Let's do that with the git rebase command
> git rebase master

Now we are checked out on the master branch. Let's go ahead and rebase onto bugFix...
> git rebase bugFix

There! Since `master` was an ancestor of `bugFix`, git simply moved the `master` branch reference forward in history.

To complete this level, do the following

Checkout a new branch named bugFix
> git checkout -b bugFix
Commit once
> git commit -m "first message for bugFix"
Go back to master and commit again
> git checkout master
> git commit -m "master now"
Check out bugFix again and rebase onto master
#important if you mess up do `undo`
> git checkout bugFix
> git rebase master #once on bugFix > rebase onto master

Good luck!

Moving around in Git
Before we get to some of the more advanced features of Git, it's important to understand different ways to move through the commit tree that represents your project.

Once you're comfortable moving around, your powers with other git commands will be amplified!

HEAD
First we have to talk about "HEAD". HEAD is the symbolic name for the currently checked out commit -- it's essentially what commit you're working on top of.

HEAD always points to the most recent commit which is reflected in the working tree. Most git commands which make changes to the working tree will start by changing HEAD.

Normally HEAD points to a branch name (like bugFix). When you commit, the status of bugFix is altered and this change is visible through HEAD.

HEAD demo:
Let's see this in action. Here we will reveal HEAD before and after a commit.
> git checkout C1
> git checkout master
> git commit
> git checkout C2

See! HEAD was hiding underneath our master branch all along.

Detaching HEAD
Detaching HEAD just means attaching it to a commit instead of a branch. This is what it looks like beforehand:

HEAD -> master -> C1

Detach HEAD from `master` and attach it to C1 commit
> git checkout C1

HEAD -> C1

To complete this level, let's detach HEAD from `bugFix` and attach it to the commit instead.

Specify this commit by its hash. The hash for each commit is displayed on the circle that represents the commit.

HEAD -> bugFix -> C1
let's detach HEAD from `bugFix` 
HEAD -> C4
and attach it to the commit C4 instead.
> git checkout C4

Relative Refs
Moving around in Git by specifying commit hashes can get a bit tedious. In the real world you won't have a nice commit tree visualization next to your terminal, so you'll have to use git log to see hashes.

Furthermore, hashes are usually a lot longer in the real Git world as well. For instance, the hash of the commit that introduced the previous level is fed2da64c0efc5293610bdd892f82a58e8cbc5d8. Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue...

The upside is that Git is smart about hashes. It only requires you to specify enough characters of the hash until it uniquely identifies the commit. So I can type fed2 instead of the long string above.

Like I said, specifying commits by their hash isn't the most convenient thing ever, which is why Git has relative refs. They are awesome!

With relative refs, you can start somewhere memorable (like the branch `bugFix` or `HEAD`) and work from there.

Relative commits are powerful, but we will introduce two simple ones here:

Moving upwards one commit at a time with `^`
Moving upwards a number of times with `~<num>`

Let's look at the Caret (^) operator first. Each time you append that to a ref name, you are telling Git to find the parent of the specified commit.

So saying master^ is equivalent to "the first parent of master".

master^^ is the grandparent (second-generation ancestor) of master

Let's check out the commit above master here
> git checkout master^

Boom! Done. Way easier than typing the commit hash

You can also reference HEAD as a relative ref. Let's use that a couple of times to move upwards in the commit tree
> git checkout C3
> git checkout HEAD^
> git checkout HEAD^
> git checkout HEAD^

We can travel backwards in time with HEAD^

To complete this level, check out the parent commit of bugFix. This will detach HEAD.

You can specify the hash if you want, but try using relative refs instead!

check out the parent commit of bugFix. This will detach HEAD.
> git checkout bugFix^ #use relative refs to parent commit of bugFix

"Relative Refs #2 (~)",
The "~" operator: like multiply
Say you want to move a lot of levels up in the commit tree. It might be tedious to type ^ several times, so Git also has the tilde (~) operator.

The tilde operator (optionally) takes in a trailing number that specifies the number of parents you would like to ascend. Let's see it in action

Let's specify a number of commits back with ~
> git checkout HEAD~4 #move up 4 levels or parents

## Branch forcing
You're an expert on relative refs now, so let's actually use them for something.

One of the most common ways I use relative refs is to move branches around. You can directly reassign a branch to a commit with the -f option. So something like:

> git branch -f master HEAD~3

moves (by force) the master branch to three parents behind HEAD.

C4(Master/buFix*) -> C3 -> C2 -> C1 -> C0

> git branch -f master HEAD~3 #rolls back master

Relative refs gave us a concise way to refer to `C1` and branch forcing (`-f`) gave us a way to quickly move a branch to that location.

Now that you have seen relative refs and branch forcing in combination, let's use them to solve the next level.

To complete this level, move `HEAD`, `master`, and `bugFix` to their goal destinations shown.

> git branch -f bugFix bugFix~3 #bugFix will jump 3 times of its parent up the commit tree and directly reassign a branch to a commit _(with the -f option)_

> git checkout C1 #move HEAD from c2 to c1
> git branch -f master C6 #move master to C6 (remember to directly reassign a branch to a commit with the -f option)

# Reversing Changes in Git", the next level
Reversing Changes in Git
There are many ways to reverse changes in Git. And just like committing, reversing changes in Git has both a low-level component (staging individual files or chunks) and a high-level component (how the changes are actually reversed). Our application will focus on the latter.

There are two primary ways to undo changes in Git -- one is using `git reset` and the other is using `git revert`. We will look at each of these in the next dialog

# Git Reset: git reset HEAD "rewriting history;"
git reset reverts changes by moving a branch reference backwards in time to an older commit. In this sense you can think of it as "rewriting history;" git reset will move a branch backwards as if the commit had never been made in the first place.

Let's see what that looks like:
`> git reset HEAD~1` #Git moved the master branch reference back to C1; now our local repository is in a state as if C2 had never happened.

## Git Revert: reverse changes and share those reversed changes
While resetting works great for local branches on your own machine, its method of "rewriting history" doesn't work for remote branches that others are using.

In order to reverse changes and share those reversed changes with others, we need to use git revert. Let's see it in action

`> git revert HEAD` #new commit C2' introdues changes (undo reverses the commit of C2), you can push out your changes to share with others

Weird, a new commit plopped down below the commit we wanted to reverse. That's because this new commit C2' introduces changes -- it just happens to introduce changes that exactly reverses the commit of C2.

With reverting, you can push out your changes to share with others.

To complete this level, reverse the most recent commit on both local and pushed. You will revert two commits total (one per branch).

1. reverse the most recent commit on both local and pushed. You will revert two commits total (one per branch).
> git reset HEAD~1 #local* commit reverse
> git checkout pushed #remote therefore we are not on it now. we need to checkout then move HEAD
> git revert HEAD 

Keep in mind that pushed is a remote branch and local is a local branch -- that should help you choose your methods.

pushed : remote
local : local branch

# "Cherry-pick Intro", the next level?
- Moving Work Around
So far we've covered the basics of git -- committing, branching, and moving around in the source tree. Just these concepts are enough to leverage 90% of the power of git repositories and cover the main needs of developers.

That remaining 10%, however, can be quite useful during complex workflows (or when you've gotten yourself into a bind). The next concept we're going to cover is "moving work around" -- in other words, it's a way for developers to say "I want this work here and that work there" in precise, eloquent, flexible ways.

This may seem like a lot, but it's a simple concept.
- Git Cherry-pick
The first command in this series is called git cherry-pick. It takes on the following form:

git cherry-pick <Commit1> <Commit2> <...>
It's a very straightforward way of saying that you would like to copy a series of commits below your current location (HEAD). I personally love cherry-pick because there is very little magic involved and it's easy to understand.

- Here's a repository where we have some work in branch `side` that we want to copy to `master`. This could be accomplished through a rebase (which we have already learned), but let's see how cherry-pick performs.

`> git cherry-pick C2 C4` #cherry-pick commits C2 and C4, git plopped them down right below us. 
  > git cherry-pick bugFix side^ another #relative path use of cherry-pick
  > git cherry-pick C3 C4 C7 #I am on C1 master*, cherry-pick commits C3', C4', C7', git plopped them down right below C1 (master*)

- Git Interactive Rebase:
Git cherry-pick is great when you know which commits you want (and you know their corresponding hashes) -- it's hard to beat the simplicity it provides.

But what about the situation where you don't know what commits you want? Thankfully git has you covered there as well! We can use interactive rebasing for this -- it's the best way to review a series of commits you're about to rebase.

Let's dive into the details...

All interactive rebase means is using the `rebase` command with the `-i` option.

If you include this option, git will open up a UI to show you which commits are about to be copied below the target of the rebase. It also shows their commit hashes and messages, which is great for getting a bearing on what's what.

For "real" git, the UI window means opening up a file in a text editor like vim. For our purposes, I've built a small dialog window that behaves the same way.

When the interactive rebase dialog opens, you have the ability to do 3 things:

* You can reorder commits simply by changing their order in the UI (in our window this means dragging and dropping with the mouse).
* You can choose to completely omit some commits. This is designated by `pick` -- toggling `pick` off means you want to drop the commit.
* Lastly, you can squash commits. Unfortunately our `levels` don't support this for a few logistical reasons, so I'll skip over the details of this. Long story short, though -- it allows you to combine commits.

- interactive rebase window will appear. Reorder some commits around (or feel free to unpick some) and see the result!
> git rebase -i HEAD~4

To finish this level, do an interactive rebase and achieve the order shown in the goal visualization. Remember you can always undo or reset to fix mistakes :D

- Locally stacked commits
Here's a development situation that often happens: I'm trying to track down a bug but it is quite elusive. In order to aid in my detective work, I put in a few debug commands and a few print statements.

`All` of these debugging / print statements are in their own commits. Finally I track down the bug, fix it, and rejoice!

Only problem is that I now need to get my `bugFix` back into the `master` branch. If I simply fast-forwarded `master`, then `master` would get all my debug statements which is undesirable. There has to be another way...

We need to tell git to copy only one of the commits over. This is just like the levels earlier on moving work around -- we can use the same commands:

  `> git rebase -i`
  `> git cherry-pick`
To achieve this goal.

- Juggling Commits
Here's another situation that happens quite commonly. You have some changes (newImage) and another set of changes (caption) that are related, so they are stacked on top of each other in your repository (aka one after another).

The tricky thing is that sometimes you need to make a small modification to an earlier commit. In this case, design wants us to change the dimensions of newImage slightly, even though that commit is way back in our history!!

We will overcome this difficulty by doing the following:

We will re-order the commits so the one we want to change is on top with `git rebase -i`
We will `commit --amend` to make the slight modification
`Then` we will re-order the commits back to how they were previously with `git rebase -i`
Finally, we will move `master` to this updated part of the tree to finish the level (via the method of your choosing)

There are many ways to accomplish this overall goal (I see you eye-ing cherry-pick), and we will see more of them later, but for now let's focus on this technique. Lastly, pay attention to the goal state here -- since we move the commits twice, they both get an apostrophe appended. One more apostrophe is added for the commit we amend, which gives us the final form of the tree

That being said, I can compare levels now based on structure and relative apostrophe differences. As long as your tree's master branch has the same structure and relative apostrophe differences, I'll give full credit

> show solution // to see the answer
> reset --forSolution // reset the solution

1) You have some changes (newImage:C2) and another set of changes (caption:C3) that are related, so they are stacked on top of each other in your repository (aka one after another).
** We will re-order the commits so the one we want to change is on top with `git rebase -i`
> git rebase -i HEAD~2 #move to master branch by jumping twice, I am currently on caption which is 2 steps behind
Next, re-order C3 and C2 in interactive git rebase.

2) We will `commit --amend` to make the slight modification
> git commit --ammend

3) re-order the commits back to how they were previously with `git rebase -i`
> git rebase -i HEAD~2 #re-order the commits

4) Move `master` to this updated part of the tree to finish the level (via the method of your choosing)
> git rebase caption master

- Juggling Commits #2
If you haven't completed Juggling Commits #1 (the previous level), please do so before continuing

As you saw in the last level, we used rebase -i to reorder the commits. Once the commit we wanted to change was on top, we could easily --amend it and re-order back to our preferred order.

The only issue here is that there is a lot of reordering going on, which can introduce rebase conflicts. Let's look at another method with git cherry-pick

> git cherry-pick will plop down a commit from anywhere in the tree onto HEAD (as long as that commit isn't an ancestor of HEAD).

Here's a small refresher demo:
> git cherry-pick C2 # master* => only pick that C2 bugfix and commit

So in this level, let's accomplish the same objective of amending C2 once but avoid using rebase -i. I'll leave it up to you to figure it out! :D

Remember, the exact number of apostrophe's (') on the commit are not important, only the relative differences. For example, I will give credit to a tree that matches the goal tree but has one extra apostrophe everywhere

Same goal now with cherry-pick:
> git checkout master #bring the HEAD to master
> git cherry-pick C2 #plop C2 on master
> git commit --amend #now that change is on top, we could easily --amend it
> git cherry-pick C3 #plop C3 on ammended master with C2
done

- Git Tags
As you have learned from previous lessons, branches are easy to move around and often refer to different commits as work is completed on them. Branches are easily mutated, often temporary, and always changing.

If that's the case, you may be wondering if there's a way to permanently mark historical points in your project's history. For things like major releases and big merges, is there any way to mark these commits with something more permanent than a branch?

You bet there is! Git tags support this exact use case -- they (somewhat) permanently mark certain commits as "milestones" that you can then reference like a branch.

More importantly though, they never move as more commits are created. You can't "check out" a tag and then complete work on that tag -- tags exist as anchors in the commit tree that designate certain spots.

Let's see what tags look like in practice.
Let's try making a tag at C1 which is our version 1 prototype:
> git tag v1 C1

There! Quite easy. We named the tag v1 and referenced the commit C1 explicitly. If you leave the commit off, git will just use whatever HEAD is at


For this level just create the tags in the goal visualization and then check v1 out. Notice how you go into detached HEAD state -- this is because you can't commit directly onto the v1 tag.

In the next level we'll examine a more interesting use case for tags.

> git checkout C2 # move the head to C2
> git tag V1 C2 # tag C2 with V1
> git tag V0 C1 # tag C1 with V0

# Git Describe
Because tags serve as such great "anchors" in the codebase, git has a command to describe where you are relative to the closest "anchor" (aka tag). And that command is called git describe!

Git describe can help you get your bearings after you've moved many commits backwards or forwards in history; this can happen after you've completed a git bisect (a debugging search) or when sitting down at a coworkers computer who just got back from vacation.

- Git describe takes the form of:

`git describe <ref>`

Where `<ref>` is anything git can resolve into a commit. If you don't specify a ref, git just uses where you're checked out right now (`HEAD`).

The output of the command looks like:

<tag>_<numCommits>_g<hash>

Where `tag` is the closest ancestor tag in history, `numCommits` is how many commits away that tag is, and `<hash>` is the hash of the commit being described.

`> git tag v2 C3`

The command `git describe master` would output:

`> v1_2_gC2`

Whereas `git describe side` would output:

`> v2_1_gC4`

That's pretty much all there is to git describe! Try describing a few of the locations in this level to get a feel for the command.

Once you're ready, just go ahead and commit once to finish the level. We're giving you a freebie :P

- Git Remotes
Remote repositories aren't actually that complicated. In today's world of cloud computing it's easy to think that there's a lot of magic behind git remotes, but they are actually just copies of your repository on another computer. You can typically talk to this other computer through the Internet, which allows you to transfer commits back and forth.

That being said, remote repositories have a bunch of great properties:

First and foremost, remotes serve as a great backup! Local git repositories have the ability to restore files to a previous state (as you know), but all that information is stored locally. By having copies of your git repository on other computers, you can lose all your local data and still pick up where you left off.

More importantly, remotes make coding social! Now that a copy of your project is hosted elsewhere, your friends can contribute to your project (or pull in your latest changes) very easily.

It's become very popular to use websites that visualize activity around remote repos (like Github or Phabricator(https://www.phacility.com/)), but remote repositories always serve as the underlying backbone for these tools. So it's important to understand them!

- Our Command to create remotes
Up until this point, Learn Git Branching has focused on teaching the basics of local repository work (branching, merging, rebasing, etc). However now that we want to learn about remote repository work, we need a command to set up the environment for those lessons. `git clone` will be that command

Technically, `git clone` in the real world is the command you'll use to create local copies of remote repositories (from github for example). We use this command a bit differently in Learn Git Branching though -- `git clone` actually makes a remote repository out of your local one. Sure it's technically the opposite meaning of the real command, but it helps build the connection between cloning and remote repository work, so let's just run with it for now.

Lets start slow and just look at what a remote repository looks like (in our visualization).

There it is! Now we have a remote repository of our project. It looks pretty similar except for some visual changes to make the distinction apparent -- in later levels you'll get to see how we share work across these repositories.

Git Remote Branches
Now that you've seen git clone in action, let's dive into what actually changed.

The first thing you may have noticed is that a new branch appeared in our local repository called o/master. This type of branch is called a remote branch; remote branches have special properties because they serve a unique purpose.

**Remote branches** reflect the state of remote repositories (since you last talked to those remote repositories). They help you understand the difference between your local work and what work is public -- a critical step to take before sharing your work with others.

Remote branches have the special property that when you check them out, you are put into detached `HEAD` mode. Git does this on purpose because you can't work on these branches directly; you have to work elsewhere and then share your work with the remote (after which your remote branches will be updated).

What is o/? (originc)
You may be wondering what the leading o/ is for on these remote branches. Well, remote branches also have a (required) naming convention -- they are displayed in the format of:

  - <remote name>/<branch name>
    origin/master

Hence, if you look at a branch named o/master, the branch name is master and the name of the remote is o.

Most developers actually name their main remote origin, not o. This is so common that git actually sets up your remote to be named origin when you git clone a repository.

Unfortunately the full name of origin does not fit in our UI, so we use o as shorthand :( Just remember when you're using real git, your remote is probably going to be named origin!

That's a lot to take in, so let's see 
> git checkout origin master
> git commit

As you can see, git put us into detached HEAD mode and then did not update o/master when we added a new commit. This is because o/master will only update when the remote updates.

To finish this level, commit once off of master and once after checking out o/master. This will help drive home how remote branches behave differently, and they only update to reflect the state of the remote.

1) commit once off of master 
  > git commit
2) commit once after checking out o/master
  > git check out o/master
  > git commit

- Git Fetch
Working with git remotes really just boils down to transferring data to and from other repositories. As long as we can send commits back and forth, we can share any type of update that is tracked by git (and thus share work, new files, new ideas, love letters, etc.).

## Git Fetch
In this lesson we will learn how to fetch data from a remote repository -- the command for this is conveniently named `git fetch.`

You'll notice that as we update our representation of the remote repository, our remote branches will update to reflect that new representation. This ties into the previous lesson on remote branches

Before getting into the details of git fetch, let's see it in action! Here we have a remote repository that contains two commits that our local repository does not have.


There we go! Commits C2 and C3 were downloaded to our local repository, and our remote branch o/master was updated to reflect this.

## What fetch does

`git fetch` performs two main steps, and two main steps only. It:

- downloads the commits that the remote has but are missing from our local repository, and...
- updates where our remote branches point (for instance, `o/master`)

`git fetch` essentially brings our local representation of the remote repository into synchronization with what the actual remote repository looks like (right now).

If you remember from the previous lesson, we said that remote branches reflect the state of the remote repositories since you last talked to those remotes. `git fetch` is the way you talk to these remotes! Hopefully the connection between remote branches and `git fetch` is apparent now.

`git fetch` usually talks to the remote repository through the Internet (via a protocol like `http://` or `git://`).

### What fetch doesn't do (no change to local state)
`git fetch`, however, does not change anything about your local state. It will not update your `master` branch or change anything about how your file system looks right now.

This is important to understand because a lot of developers think that running `git fetch` will make their local work reflect the state of the remote. It may download all the necessary data to do that, but it does not actually change any of your local files. We will learn commands in later lessons to do just that :D

So at the end of the day, you can think of running **`git fetch` as a download step.**

- To finish the level, simply `git fetch` and download all the commits!

## Git Pull
Now that we've seen how to fetch data from a remote repository with `git fetch`, let's update our work to reflect those changes!

There are actually many ways to do this -- once you have new commits available locally, you can incorporate them as if they were just normal commits on other branches. This means you could execute commands like (`git pull` is same as):

> git cherry-pick o/master
> git rebase o/master
>git merge o/master
etc., etc.
In fact, the workflow of fetching remote changes and then merging them is so common that git actually provides a command that does both at once! That command is `git pull`.

### fetch and a merge executed sequentially
Let's first see a fetch and a merge executed sequentially

`> git fetch`
`> git merge origin master` (in this excercise we say git merge o/master)

Boom -- we downloaded C3 with a `fetch` and then merged in that work with git merge o/master. Now our master branch reflects the new work from the remote (in this case, named origin)

we used `git pull` instead?
`> git pull`

The same thing! That should make it very clear that git pull is essentially shorthand for a git fetch followed by a merge of whatever branch was just fetched.


We will explore the details of `git pull` later (including options and arguments), but for now let's try it out in the level.

Remember -- you can actually solve this level with just `fetch` and `merge`, but it will cost you an extra command :P

- Simulating collaboration
So here is the tricky thing -- for some of these upcoming lessons, we need to teach you how to pull down changes that were introduced in the remote.

That means we need to essentially "pretend" that the remote was updated by one of your coworkers / friends / collaborators, sometimes on a specific branch or a certain number of commits.

In order to do this, we introduced the aptly-named command git fakeTeamwork! It's pretty self explanatory, let's see a demo...

The default behavior of fakeTeamwork is to simply plop down a commit on master

`> git fakeTeamwork `

There we go -- the remote was updated with a new commit, and we haven't downloaded that commit yet because we haven't run git fetch.

You can also specify the number of commits or the branch by appending them to the command

> git fakeTeamwork foo 3 #simulated a teammate pushing three commits to the `foo` branch on our remote

With one command we simulated a teammate pushing three commits to the `foo` branch on our remote

- chellenge:
Go ahead and make a remote (with git clone), fake some changes on that remote, commit yourself, and then pull down those changes. It's like a few lessons in one!

1) Go ahead and make a remote (with git clone), 
> git clone
2) fake some changes on that remote, 
> git fakeTeamwork 2 #2 means there are 2 fake changes
3) commit yourself, and then 
> git commit
4) pull down those changes. It's like a few lessons in one!
> git pull

## Git Push
Ok, so I've fetched changes from remote and incorporated them into my work locally. That's great and all... but how do I share my awesome work with everyone else?

Well, the way to upload shared work is the opposite of downloading shared work. And what's the opposite of `git pull`? `git push!`

git push is responsible for uploading your changes to a specified remote and updating that remote to incorporate your new commits. Once git push completes, all your friends can then download your work from the remote.

You can think of git push as a command to "publish" your work. It has a bunch of subtleties that we will get into shortly, but let's start with baby steps...

note -- the behavior of git push with no arguments varies depending on one of git's settings called push.default. The default value for this setting depends on the version of git you're using, but we are going to use the upstream value in our lessons. This isn't a huge deal, but it's worth checking your settings before pushing in your own projects.
